<ul>
<li>It’s possible to live here in the United States and never be exposed to a foreign language</li>
<li>It’s also possible to live here and rarely see English</li>
<li>We live in a multi-cultural country</li>
<li>As developers, we want to make our products as friendly and welcoming to people as possible</li>
<li>I work at <a href="http://Niche.com">Niche.com</a>, a company who’s mission is to help people “find where [they] belong”</li>
<li>But eating away at the back of my mind was the fact that our entire site is in English</li>
<li>So should we update our tagline? “Helping English-speakers find where they belong?”</li>
<li>Instead, how can we alter our product to help <strong>everyone</strong>, or at least as many people as possible?</li>
<li>For a three-day hackathon at Niche, I tried to find an answer to that question</li>
<li>That pursuit opened the door to a whole new world of internationalization</li>
<li>There are two areas on which I want to focus:
<ol>
<li>Internationalization</li>
<li>Localization</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The first option that I</li>
<li>Translation services from companies like Google and Microsoft are valuable, but they cannot grasp the nuances of the language
<ul>
<li>For an example, on <a href="http://Niche.com">Niche.com</a> we have a section on a school profile for “Majors”: academic areas of focus</li>
<li>When you run that through an automated translator into Spanish, you get <em>Grandes Ligas</em> or “Big Leagues”</li>
<li>Google things you’re trying to find the nickname for Major League Baseball</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There isn’t an abstract syntax tree that you can parse nor a transpiler to use: Translation (for now) requires humans</li>
<li>So we set off translating!</li>
<li>The goal was to take the headings of each section on a profile and translate them into other languages
<ul>
<li>Since we didn’t have time to translate all of the content on the site, helping people orient themselves on the page with a familiar language seemed like a good place to start</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using our team (with some help from parents), we were able to translate those headings into <strong>&lt;LOOK_UP_THE_NUMBER&gt; different languages</strong>!</li>
<li>Best practices
<ul>
<li>Avoid flags to represent languages
<ul>
<li>Your cultural identity is not defined by the origin country of the language you speak</li>
<li>I get a weird feeling when visiting a usually European site with a UK flag in the top bar</li>
<li>That feeling would be worse for someone in Hong Kong or Taiwan to see a Chinese flag</li>
<li>You might be an American citizen who prefers Spanish. You shouldn’t have to see the Mexican or Spanish flag everywhere.</li>
<li>The best representation of a language is its name</li>
