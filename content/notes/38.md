Today I learned about TypeScript's non-null assertion operator: `!`. It's a nice way to let the TS compiler know that the value cannot be `null` or `undefined`, which is a pretty common use case in my experience. [This StackOverflow question and answer helped unpack things for me](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42273853/in-typescript-what-is-the-exclamation-mark-bang-operator-when-dereferenci), and [you can reference the documentation here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#non-null-assertion-operator). ❗️
