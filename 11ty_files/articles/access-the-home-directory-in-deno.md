If you want to access the home directory from you Deno program, you can use the `Deno.env`'s `get` method with `"HOME"`:

```js
Deno.env.get("HOME")
```

In unix environments, returns a string along the lines of `"/home/USER"`.

So if you want to write a script that accesses a configuration file like `.bashrc`, you could read the file with:

```js/2
// read-bashrc.ts
const bashConfig = Deno.readTextFileSync(
    Deno.env.get("HOME") + "/.bashrc"
);
```

Since we are accessing `Deno.env`, we need to run the program with the `env` permission:

```shell
deno run --allow-env read-bashrc.ts
```

Here is a Repl where you can [play around with accessing the home directory in Deno](https://repl.it/@SeanMcP/deno-access-home-directory).

Happy coding!
