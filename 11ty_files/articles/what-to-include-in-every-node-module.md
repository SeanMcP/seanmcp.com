All that is required to publish a node module is a `package.json` file with a few fields. However, there are more components to a good package.

Here are a few things to include in every node module that you publish:

- [`README.md`](#readmemd)

## `README.md`

A README contains all the information necessary to use your node module. They come in all shapes and sizes: decorated, detailed, and simple. But they all need to include a one important detail: **how to use the package**.

There are many ways to create a good README, I like the format set out by ["Make a README"](https://www.makeareadme.com/).
