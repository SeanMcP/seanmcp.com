_This playlist has been updated. [Check out the latest version of my TypeScript "mega-course" on Egghead.io](./updated-typescript-mega-course-on-egghead)._

I would say that I have "functional" understanding of TypeScript. I can get the job done (at least most of the time), but as soon as the types get hairy I struggle.

As TypeScript contiues grow in popularity, this will become a liability. To fix this, I have set a professional goal to improve my understanding of TypeScript.

Niche.com provides us with a membership to Egghead.io, so I've cobbled together multiple courses on TypeScript:

## Mega-course

1. [_Up and Running with TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-typescript) by John Lindquist (22 min)
2. [_Use Types Effectively in TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/use-types-effectively-in-typescript) by Ari Picker (29 min)
3. [_Async/Await using TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/async-await-using-typescript) by Basarat Ali Syed (17 min)
4. [_Practical Advanced TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/practical-advanced-typescript) by Rares Matei (62 min)
5. [_Advanced Static Types in TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-static-types-in-typescript) by Marius Schulz (67 min)
6. Optional: [_Use TypeScript to develop React Applications_](https://egghead.io/courses/use-typescript-to-develop-react-applications) by Basarat Ali Syed (27 min)

The plan is to complete these courses over the next three weeks. At the end, I'll review the mega-course and update the order if necessary.

Happy coding!
