To emulate an iPhone or iPad in Safari, you first need to have [the developer tools enabled](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac).

Then when visiting a page that you want to test, select "Develop" in the application toolbar then "Enter Responsive Design Mode".

This will open a special window where you can emulate your website on an array of Apple devices and user agents.

Happy emulating!
