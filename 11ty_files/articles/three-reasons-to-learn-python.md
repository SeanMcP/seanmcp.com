There are tons of reasons to learn a programming language. Maybe you are new to coding and are looking for a good place to start. Maybe you’re interested in new technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence and want to learn more. Or maybe you’re a seasoned developer who is looking to add a new language to his/her skill set.

But which to choose? There are [hundreds of programming languages out there](https://www.quora.com/How-many-programming-languages-are-there-in-the-world), each one vying for your attention. What should you do?

Never fear, faithful reader! Here are three reasons why you (yes, you!) should learn the **Python** programming language.

## 1-- Versatile

Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, designed Python to be a general purpose programming language. As a result, Python can be used in a wide variety of cases: machine learning, web development, GUI development, scientific and numeric applications, software development, system administration, and more. Whatever type of programming sparks your interest, there is probably [a Python application or framework for it](https://www.python.org/about/apps/).

Major companies like Google, Instagram, Dropbox, Spotify, Reddit, Duolingo, and BitBucket; government organizations; educational institutions; and non-profits use Python for its versatility.

## 2-- Beginner friendly

In addition to being a general purpose programming language, Python advertises itself as being “[easy to use](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/appetite.html)”. It achieves this by utilizing a simple and intuitive syntax and offering high-level data types like dictionaries.

Since 1999, Python has been guided by a series of 19 principles called the “Zen of Python.” Among these are specific guidelines to keep things simple:

```
Simple is better than complex.
Readability counts.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
```

As a result of this, Python is often used as the language in introductory computer science courses (notably [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm)). If you are looking to learn your first language or add to a growing toolbelt, Python is a great choice.

## 3-- Highly rated

In my experience, every Python developer I have met loves working in Python. And it turns out that my anecdotal observation may be right!

In [StackOverlow’s Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)-- which compiles user responses to demographic, technology, and work questions--shows that Python is a desirable language. It has been listed among the “[Most Loved](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/##most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)” languages for a while and has topped the charts in the past two years as the “[Most Desired](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)” language. If a lot of other developers like using Python, or want to learn Python, then it is probably going to be a good experience.

[Sidebar: If you haven’t before, take the time to look over the results of the [2018 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/). It isn’t perfect, suffering from both [participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias) and [response bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias), but does open a window into the world of development.]

## Bonus-- Python jokes!

Van Rossum named the Python programming language not after the [serpent genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28genus%29) (as I previously assumed) but after the British TV comedy “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.” According to the [Python Software Foundation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/appetite.html), “Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!”

There you go: three (and a half) reasons why you should learn Python.

If you are looking for a good place to get started, I recommend the [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/): they are well-written and -paced for a beginner diving into the language.

Happy coding!
