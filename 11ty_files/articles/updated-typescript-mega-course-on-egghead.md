[Last month, I embarked on a journey to learn TypeScript better](./typescript-mega-course-on-egghead). I hand-crafted a TypeScript"mega-course" on Egghead.io by cobbling multiple courses into one.

My goal was to complete the course in three weeks. Now a month and a half later, I have completed the course and am ready to reflect on my experience.

Overall, it was a beneficial experience. I learned a lot more about types and how to write meaningful generics that will help make my code more reusable.

I also gained a greater appreciation for TypeScript as a language. There were some examples where I needed to stop the video and try to read what was happened. I know TS is technically a super-set of JavaScript, but it is 100% a proficiency of its own.

## Updated Mega-course

After completing the course, I want to update and annotate the original syllabus. Here is the updated course playlist:

1. Optional: [_Up and Running with TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-typescript) by John Lindquist (22 min)
   - This was helpful, but very basic. Consider skipping this if you already know how to set up a TypeScript project
2. [_Use Types Effectively in TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/use-types-effectively-in-typescript) by Ari Picker (29 min)
   - This was a great introduction into TypeScript on its own. I learned a lot about generics, which are an important feature. 
3. [_Practical Advanced TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/practical-advanced-typescript) by Rares Matei (62 min)
    - I took more notes on this course than any of the others. This was definitely the material I needed to introduce me to more advanced TypeScript.
4. [_Advanced Static Types in TypeScript_](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-static-types-in-typescript) by Marius Schulz (67 min)
   - There was some overlap between this course and the previous, but they both did a good job of explaining core type concepts.

The updated runtime is 2 hours and 38 minutes to 3 hours, depending on whether you include the optional introduction.
  
It also drops both of Basarat Ali Syed's courses, _Async/Await using TypeScript_ and _Use Typescript to develop React Applications_. Both were fine but ultimately weren't substantial enough to be included in the mega-course.

I hope that was helpful! Let me know if you take this TypeScript "mega-course" on Egghead.io and what you think about it.

Happy learning!
