In 2017, we adopted Abby from an Atlanta-area animal shelter in 2017. This lovable pup had been at the shelter before and was given up at two. Those owners left a broken arm untreated, and the shelter staff made the difficult decision to amputate it.

Christened "Abby Normal" (a reference to Mel Brooke's _Young Frankenstein_), we took her home, and she has been a lovely part of our family ever since.

The official adoption paperwork said that she was a "Boxer Mix," but she is some variety of pit bull. She likes running around in the backyard, chasing groundhogs, and eating carrot tops.
