description: Coming out of retirement as a soccer journalist? No.
---

Once upon a time, I was pretty active in the American soccer scene writing about lower-league soccer. You can still read some of my stories on [Dirty South Soccer](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adirtysouthsoccer.com+"By+Sean+McPherson"), [The Brotherly Game](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abrotherlygame.com+"By+Sean+McPherson"), and [Penn97](https://penn97.blogspot.com/), while others are lost to time.

Writing was a fun outlet when I was less-than-content with my work as a teacher, and it helped me connect with soccer at a more local level. After changing careers and starting a family, the appeal of writing waned.

And while I'm not interested in coming out of retirement as a beat writer, I do have the occasional urge to write about a particular topic. Rather than spin up a separate site (like I tried with [Badges FC](https://medium.com/badgesfc)), I thought I'd add a little section to my own site specifically for soccer.

Will I write regularly? No. Will it be quality content? Probably not. But will it be worth reading? Maybe! We'll see.

Until next time, play on! {% emoji '⚽️' %}
