In the [words of the creator](https://cairnrpg.com/):

> Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled
> with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities.

It's a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in the style of Dungeons & Dragons but
with a bigger focus on storytelling and exploration instead of game mechanics. I
like that it provides the right amount of rules to keep the game running without
getting in the way of the experience.

Because I am me, I have created some adventures and resources for playing Cairn
with my family and friends.
