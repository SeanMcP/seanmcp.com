When playing recently with my coworkers, they received draft papers and were
summoned to a meeting with the King. He sent them on their quest and gave them a
letter with the royal seal to verify their business. After leaving town, the
players wanted to read the letter. And that's where I made a mistake.

There were two things that I wanted for this session: 1) the world to feel real,
and 2) the players backgrounds to be important. At the table we had a mercenary,
ranger, servant, and pickpocket. I decided only one of those backgrounds^[I'll
let you guess which.] would be able to read in this medieval-fantasy world. In
the moment the players accepted it and even thought it was a neat level of
realism. But what I failed to anticipate was the effect that this ruling would
have on the later game.

Reading came up in two situations later in the session.

The first was in a chapel in the woods where they encountered a message written
in Latin (or "Classical" as I styled it). I ruled that none of the players could
read Classical so the message was undecipherable. I think this was a good
ruling. It made message mysterious and the world feel more real (I wouldn't be
able to read a message in Latin in real life). And importantly the meaning
wasn't crucial to the story–just some embellishment.

The second was in a Wizard's chamber when they discovered scrolls. These were
written in Common, but I had previously ruled that only one of the players could
read. That ruling prevented everyone else in the party from using the
scrolls–from casting magic–for the rest of the session. Thankfully it was a
one-shot because otherwise those characters would have been barred from using
magic until they first learned to read.

Realism is good. It makes the world immersive and nudges the players into role
playing. But when running a game we need to make sure that players are able to
_play_ the game. And that might require us to break realism a bit to facilitate
a good time. I should have ruled that all players could read Common^[If a player
wanted to play an illiterate character and understood the implications, I think
that could be really interesting. My problem was springing it upon the players
when they didn't know what that would mean later in the game.], just maybe with
different levels of fluency.

Is that true to medieval history? No. But it let's the players play, which is
why we're all there in the first place.
