## Tables

### Encounters

This table is a template that you can create for every environment in your
adventure and the creatures available in your game. Roll 1d6 to determine what
type of creature the players encounter. For extra challenge and flavor, add 1 or
2 to the roll.

| d6 + Challenge | Creature                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1              | Naturally occurring prey     |
| 2              | Naturally occurring predator |
| 3              | Traveler/hunter              |
| 4              | Bandit/brigand               |
| 5              | Acolytes                     |
| 6              | Fantasy creature             |
| 7              | Fantasy humanoid             |
| 8              | Legendary/mythical creature  |

Roll 1d6 to determine the creature's motivation–what they need to satisfy.

| d6  | Motivation                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Hunger/thirst**: Looking for someone/thing to satiate      |
| 2   | **Anger**: Provoked and looking for revenge                  |
| 3   | **Self-preservation**: Need to defend themselves or others   |
| 4   | **Orders**: Following directions from another                |
| 5   | **Curiosity**: Looking for something interesting             |
| 6   | **Fear**: Want to flee from the players (or something worse) |

And finally, roll 1d6 to determine the creature's complication–what is
preventing them from achieving their goal.

| d6  | Complication                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Illness**: Broken limb, rabies                        |
| 2   | **Lost/confused**: Knocked unconscious, wandering alone |
| 3   | **Trapped**: Literally or figuratively                  |
| 4   | **Enchanted**: Unable to sleep, driven mad, electric    |
| 5   | **Broken/missing tools**: Lost shovel, broken tooth     |
| 6   | **Distracted**: Another larger threat, cobwebs          |
