Wolves are frequent antagonists in history and folktales. I'm not going to judge
people from history; the had their reasons for being fearful of wolves. But we
know now that wolves are an integral part of their ecosystem and little thread
to humans.

I have had an affinity for wolves since second grade, and the trope of
villainous wolves in literature and games has never sit well with me. I want to
rethink wolves in adventure games specifically to give them a more nuanced—even
a positive—role in fantasy worlds.

- Wolves are neutral good
  - View their calling as noble
  - Honor their word
- Social
  - Packs consist of a mated pair and their offspring (2d4)
  - Lone wolves avoid human contact while they search for a mate
- Wolves are the natural protectors of the wild
  - Keep animal populations in check
  - Root out evil creatures
- Diet
  - Will eat evil creatures if necessary
  - Prefer natural game
  - Will eat livestock if there animal populations and evil creatures are in
    check
- Interactions with humans
  - Mature wolves can speak Common
  - Experts can understand young wolves' vocalization and mannerisms
  - Generally avoid humans
  - Symbiotic relationship with human settlements
    - Wolves protect the settlements from threats
    - Referred to as "Guardians"
    - The superstitious believe that wolves bring good luck to a village
    - Small settlements try to attract wolves to their area
    - Settlement provides wolves with food when necessary
    - Wolves summon the local ruler to a monthly meeting by howling
- Vampires can turn into jet-black pumas
  - They rarely choose wolves as their animal due to their good reputation
