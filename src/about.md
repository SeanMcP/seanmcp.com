  About Sean McPherson (seanmcp), a software engineer in Pittsburgh, PA.
---

My name is [Sean McPherson (or seanmcp)](/articles/how-to-pronounce-my-name),
and this is my personal site. Here I mostly write and mostly about software
engineering. But you'll find articles and resources for my other interests and
hobbies.

## Professionally

I work as a software engineer at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org)
building AI-powered activities for students and teachers like
[Writing Coach](https://www.khanmigo.ai/writingcoach).

I have previously worked as a software engineer for Niche.com in Pittsburgh and
[TSYS](https://www.tsys.com/) in Atlanta. And before that I was a teacher at
Gwinnett County Public Schools, AmeriCorps, and a juvenile detention center.

I graduated from Edinboro University with a degree in middle-level education and
later The Iron Yard Coding Bootcamp.

## Personally

I live in Pittsburgh, PA with my wife and two sons. I serve as a deacon at my
local presbyterian church, and volunteer on the
[Wilkinsburg Public Library](https://wilkinsburglibrary.org) Board of Directors.

I watch, read about, and play soccer; and play [board](/board-games) and
[adventure](/adventure-games) games.
