## Improving on perfection

Klaus Teuber's (_Settlers of_) _Catan_ is an award-winning strategy board game
loved by millions. However, a game of Catan can run long and can be one-sided
from the outset. In order to address these minor shortcomings, _Sanders of
Catan_ was developed.

_Sanders of Catan_ aims to make the game faster and encourage parity among the
players, regardless of experience, board, or dice.

_Sanders of Catan_ is compatible with the Catan 5-6 Player Extension pack.

## Rules

_Sanders of Catan_ is played with a standard Catan game with a few altered
rules.

### Resources

Players acquire resources more rapidly in _Sanders of Catan_.

1. At the beginning of each turn, a player rolls the dice
2. The roll activates all of the tiles on the board with a chip with the same
   number
3. Next, the roll activates all of the **resources** of the same type that were
   activated in the previous step
4. Players that have a building on an **active resource** draw the appropriate
   number of resource cards from the deck in a clock-wise manner from the roller

**Example**

> Bobby rolls an eight. On the game board, one wood and one wheat tile have a
> chip with the number eight. That means all of the wood tiles and all of the
> wheat tiles on the board yield resources. Bobby has a settlement on an wood
> tile which bears a chip with a 3, and a city on a wheat tile which bears a
> chip with a 9. Since both of those **resources** were activated by his roll,
> Bobby will draw one wood and two wheat resource cards.

### The Taxman

The gray robber piece is renamed "The Taxman" and remains on the Desert tile
(renamed "Washington, DC") for the duration of the game. When a player rolls a
7:

1. All players count the number of resource cards in their hand
2. The player with the most cards (_i.e._ the "richest" player) selects half of
   his or her cards to forfeit, rounded down
3. The forfeited cards are shuffled and placed face-down on the table
4. The other players take turns drawing from the forfeited pile in a clock-wise
   manner until the pile is exhausted
5. When drawing a card from the forfeit pile, players say "Feel the Bern" to the
   forfeiter

**Example**

> Mindie rolls a seven. Bobby counts the cards in his hand and finds that he has
> eleven, the most at the table. He selects five (5) cards from his hand to
> forfeit to the Taxman, shuffles them, and places them in a pile. The other
> players at the table take turns drawing cards and telling Bobby to "Feel the
> Bern."

## Attribution

"_Sanders of Catan_" was coined by Carl Parkin. The rules were fine tuned by
Carl and his wife Tayler with the help of Sean and Anne McPherson.

_Sanders of Catan_ was inspired by Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) 2016 Presidential
campaign. _Sanders of Catan_ is not (yet) endorsed by Sen. Sanders.
