**Jan 11, 2025** ‚Äî I'm starting to rethink how I combined notes/gardens into
articles (classic). I think I only did that because of how my site was
architected in Astro. Now that I'm moving back to Eleventy, I don't see a good
reason why I couldn't have those separate sections again.

_[Several hours later...]_ I moved all of notes out of articles and into
[the void](/void). I think that's a better place for them.

---

**June 28, 2024** ‚Äî
[MDN distinguishes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API#concepts_and_usage)
between two different "popover" UI patterns:

1. **Modals**: prevent interaction with overlapped elements, use `dialog`
   element
2. **Non-modals**: allow interaction with overlapped elements, use Popover API
   Conceptually this is helpful, but I wish we had more consensus across
   engineering and design on these terms.

---

**June 27, 2024** ‚Äî Maybe if I have a nice script for creating notes then I'll
write more of them.

---

**May 17, 2024** ‚Äî There are some days when writing for this website comes so
easily, and other days where it is a chore. I don't know the difference between
the two. Today things are coming easily.

---

**February 1, 2024** ‚Äî It's easy to complain about things, and too often I find
myself taking the easy road. We have enough of that in the world: let's pick a
different path.

**January 12, 2024** ‚Äî <e-moji>üï∂Ô∏è</e-moji>
[`color-scheme` is a CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme)
that affects the "theme" of a website. You can use it to quickly switch a page
to dark mode with:

```css
html {
  color-scheme: dark;
}
```

It's pretty neat, but it only applies to certain elements. You can use it on
`html` to set the scheme for the entire page, and on some form control elements
like `input` and `select`.

---

**January 12, 2024** ‚Äî I added notes to this site in 2021, but I don't think
I've ever settled on _what_ a note is. For what purpose do notes exist? I'm
going to meditate on that this year. Maybe I will come up with something that is
useful for me and anyone else who stumbles upon them.

---

**November 25, 2023** ‚Äî I've been digging into web components recently and
open-sourced two components today:

- [dark-mode-toggle](https://github.com/SeanMcP/dark-mode-toggle-web-component)
- [nav-search](https://github.com/SeanMcP/nav-search-web-component) (still a
  WIP) Both of them follow the
  ["HTML web component" pattern](https://adactio.com/journal/20618) of adding
  interactivity to their children without touching the shadow DOM. I think there
  is a lot of potential in this pattern, so I'm excited to explore it with more
  components.

---

**August 7, 2023** ‚Äî I just landed a PR that standardizes all of the dates in my
content. Based on my testing, there should only be a few older articles affected
by this change. My hope is that the new format provides a more accurate
indication of when content was published or updated.

---

**July 25, 2023** ‚Äî After a four-month hiatus, I got my website running on
Windows again.
[The `runtime: out of memory` error that I encountered](https://github.com/withastro/compiler/issues/761)
went away after I installed a larger solid-state drive. I'm glad to have the
issue resolved, but it's crazy to me that **memory** could be the reason why a
static-site generator falls over. I guess this is the world that we live and
work in now.

---

**July 13, 2023** ‚Äî I have to update two Chrome extensions, but I'm dragging my
feet because the release process is so involved. I've been spoiled by services
like Netlify that handle all of that for you.

---

**July 6, 2023** ‚Äî I created a [Threads](https://threads.net) account yesterday
in the ongoing pursuit of finding a Twitter-like experience that is a net
positive for me. The app looks neat and works fine, but there are two big
issues:

1. There is no way to surface content from non-verified users (_i.e._ normal
   people)
2. There is no way to view only posts from accounts you follow In its current
   iteration, Threads is an app for eavesdropping on Instagram influences,
   celebrities, and brands. I don't see how that provides lasting value to most
   people after the launch excitement fades.

---

**June 8, 2023** ‚Äî This morning I updated Astro from `v2.0.9` to `v2.6.1` and
all other Astro packages without any issues.
[You can see the full diff here](https://github.com/SeanMcP/seanmcp.com/pull/56/files#diff-7ae45ad102eab3b6d7e7896acd08c427a9b25b346470d7bc6507b6481575d519).
[The Astro team announced improvements to images](https://astro.build/blog/images/)
in a recent blog post, and I'm interested in checking those out. It's been on my
todo list to improve how I handle images on this site.

---

**May 24, 2023** ‚Äî I added a new [gardens](/gardens) section to the site. This
will contain evergreen resources on a particular topic that are organized by how
recently they've been updated. This seemed a more natural solution than updating
old articles and tampering with the RSS feed. Let me know what you think!

---

**May 6, 2023** ‚Äî [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) doesn't run pre- and post-scripts by
default. You need to explicitly enable this behavior by
[configuring `enable-pre-post-scripts`](https://pnpm.io/cli/run#enable-pre-post-scripts):

```shell
pnpm config set enable-pre-post-scripts true
```

This updates the [local or global pnpm config file](https://pnpm.io/cli/config).

---

**April 18, 2023** ‚Äî I released a new design for 2023 this morning. I don't
think there is enough for a full write up, but I'm going with a new "less is
more" philosophy. If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out:
sean@seanmcp.com

---

**March 15, 2023** ‚Äî I ran into an issue this morning where Astro stopped
working on my Windows machine. `2.0.9` is working on MacOS but gives the
following error in Windows:

```
runtime: out of memory: cannot allocate 4194304-byte block (4030464 in use)
fatal error: out of memory
```

I don't think this is an Astro issue, since nothing has changed since it was
last working. I don't know of anything that changed in my enviroment, but maybe
there is a memory leak somewhere causing me to run out?

---

**February 25, 2023** ‚Äî My wife has informed me that "Up the INSERT_NOUN" is not
a common phrase. I first heard it in my
[folk-punk days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeBpMVSSuvQ), and I had assumed
that it was more common. Live and learn! **Update**: She has since told me that
she thought it sounded like a vulgarity.

---

**January 6, 2023** ‚Äî There was an interesting Slack thread at work today
discussing how to meet and make friends as an adult. A lot of folks chimed in
and shared their experience and some things that have worked for them. As a
Christian who is active in a church community, I've never encountered these
challenges. But I'm empathetic towards those who have: meaningful in-person
relationships are necessary and increasingly difficult to find.

**November 22, 2022** ‚Äî Reflecting on the recent situation at Twitter,

**November 3, 2022** ‚Äî YouTube is rolling out handles for their channels, and I
was able to snag [@seanmcp](https://youtube.com/@seanmcp). There are a lot of
Sean McPs in the world, so it always feels like a victory when I get to a handle
first. Is that petty? üòÖ

**October 13, 2022** ‚Äî For a long time I avoided using the `.mjs` extension with
Node.js because it felt odd. But after years of fiddling with package `type`s
and CLI arguments to get it to run ES Modules, I've come around to "Michael
Jackson Script". I'm looking forward to the day when ESM are the default in
Node.js, but until then: _viva la `.mjs`_.

---

**October 13, 2022** ‚Äî I've added a bookmarking feature to the site! When you're
looking at an article or note, you'll see a little bookmark icon to the top
right. If you toggle that, it will save the page in `localStorage` and highlight
it whenever you browse [articles](/articles) or [notes](/notes). I know that I'm
going to find this useful, and I hope that you do too! üîñ

---

**October 6, 2022** ‚Äî This morning I spent some time trying out
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the first time, and... it did not go
well üôà I say this as a big Svelte fan, but it feels like Kit was designed to be
unpleasant to use. Complicated patterns at every turn, and an undecipherable
build for the uninitiated. My hope was that SvelteKit would be a great tool to
build projects in Svelte (that _is_ what it says on the tin), but I guess I'll
need to look elsewhere.

---

**August 3, 2022** ‚Äî IÔªø've been a big fan of CodeSandbox.io since it released.
However, recently I noticed that when you want to convert a sandbox to a GitHub
repository, it requires access to your organizations too. I'm happy to give them
access to my GitHub account, but I do not want to give them permissions to edit
repos at Khan Academy. This seems like strange oversight from the CodeSandbox
team. ü§î

---

**July 14, 2022** ‚Äî I spent some time this morning looking into
[`zx`, Google's tool for writing shell scripts in JavaScript](https://github.com/google/zx).
They have a lot of neat features baked in, but one of the coolest I saw was the
ability to
[execute scripts from a Markdown file](https://github.com/google/zx/blob/main/docs/markdown.md).
That's a much more approachable way to document scripts than code comments! ‚ú®

**July 13, 2022** ‚Äî This is the first note created by Netlify CMS in production
üöÄ

---

**July 13, 2022** ‚Äî Today I added Netlify CMS to the site in order to make it
easier to add [notes](/notes). I may expand the feature for articles in the
future. The most difficult part of the process was the limited control over file
slugs. Notes are numbered and incremented, but there wasn't a good way to do
that with Netlify CMS without adding a new field. Oh well. Hopefully the ease of
use will trump the annoyance of unnecessary data.

---

**July 12, 2022** ‚Äî Today I learned about TypeScript's non-null assertion
operator: `!`. It's a nice way to let the TS compiler know that the value cannot
be `null` or `undefined`, which is a pretty common use case in my experience.
[This StackOverflow question and answer helped unpack things for me](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42273853/in-typescript-what-is-the-exclamation-mark-bang-operator-when-dereferenci),
and
[you can reference the documentation here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#non-null-assertion-operator).

---

**June 24, 2022** ‚Äî I added a new feature to the site called "stars." When it is
enabled, you can add a little star anywhere on the site by tapping. I'm planning
to write an article about why I wrote it, but in the meantime let me know if you
have any feedback on the feature: sean@seanmcp.com

**Edit**: Stars are dead. [Long live bookmarks](/notes/44)!

**April 21, 2022** ‚Äî This week I gave a talk titled _React Bug Catcher: Tools

but I _really_ underestimated (again) how much time it takes to prepare a
conference talk. ‚åõÔ∏è

**March 24, 2022** ‚Äî Requesting data _before_ rendering the user interface is
putting the horse before the cart. It's great to see tools like React Router
moving in that direction. üêé https://remix.run/blog/remixing-react-router

**March 23, 2022** ‚Äî I started watching Brian Vaughn's
[_Deep dive with the React DevTools profiler_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySib7ipZdk)

tips for creating more performant React applications as well. Watching it was a
good use of 37 minutes!

**March 18, 2022** ‚Äî In doing research on debugging, I've found
[Diomidis Spinellis' _Effective Debugging_](https://www.spinellis.gr/debugging/)

that illustrate the recommendations well. If you are looking for a general book

**April 28, 2021** ‚Äî Netlify is moving their React UI component library to
Tailwind CSS:

**March 16, 2021** ‚Äî This morning I added a new page with an embedded emoji
picker: https://www.seanmcp.com/sm/emoji-picker/ It embeds
[Nolan Lawson's `emoji-picker` web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@@npm/emoji-picker-element)
in a webpage and prompts you to copy when selecting an emoji. You can see the
[source code here](https://github.com/SeanMcP/seanmcp.com/blob/master/src/sm/emoji-picker.njk).
I'll use this when doing computer activities with my three-year-old son, but
