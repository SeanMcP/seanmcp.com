[In #6](/articles/a-few-things-6) I shared [Trivia Pig](https://triviapig.com/),
the Wordle-inspired trivia game. After playing it for a week I can confidently
say that I am not good at trivia. But my wife and I have been playing every
night before bed, and it's been fun to share our successes (but mostly failures)
together.

Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[Open Syllabus: Explorer](https://explorer.opensyllabus.org/)**<br/>Recently
   I was looking to find a popular textbook for a given topic. That search led
   me to Open Syllabus, a database of over 7 million college syllabi from across
   the world. You can find the most commonly assigned for a given area of study.
   Pretty niche, but it's great to have in your pocket for later.

2. **[_Best Trash Bag? Letâ€™s Find Out!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw9SMpywYHY)**
   by Project Farm<br/>This YouTube channel has videos of comprehensive tests
   for competing consumer products. In this video they test trash bags to see
   which are the best based on their metrics. I love that they do what I think
   of doing when I'm at the store but know that I don't have time for. It's an
   interesting watch, but

3. **[_Living for Plants_](https://shawcat.itch.io/living-for-plants) by
   shawcat**<br/>Play as a skeleton caring for their plants. I had plans to
   build a very similar game, but this is 10 times better than anything I would
   have created!

4. **[Obvious Plant Store](https://obviousplant.com/)**<br/>My wife showed me
   this store, and we both shared a good laugh. You will either think these are
   funny or you won't. Which I now realize is true of all things but
   particularly these.
