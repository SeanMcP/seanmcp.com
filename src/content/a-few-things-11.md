Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

## [Why I am a Christian](https://faculty.som.yale.edu/jameschoi/whychrist/) by James J. Choi

Choi, a professor of Finance at Yale, shares his reasons for being a Christian.
The whole article is worth reading, but I wanted to highlight the sections
surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection:

> **Christianity is falsifiable**<br/> MANY RELIGIOUS CLAIMS ARE NOT VERIFIABLE
> OR FALSIFIABLE<br/>Claim: Religious Figure X received a divine
> revelation<br/>On what basis would you confirm or deny that claim?<br/></br>
> CHRISTIANITY IS DIFFERENT<br/>It makes a claim that an event happened in space
> and time: Jesus Christ died and then was raised from the dead. And it says, if
> this didn’t happen, you should dismiss the entire religion.

> **There is credible evidence for Jesus’ death and resurrection**<br/>
> Non-Christian philosopher of religion Antony Flew: “The evidence for the
> resurrection is better than for claimed miracles in any other religion. It’s
> outstandingly different in quality and quantity.”

## [The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better.](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) by Max Roser (Our World in Data)

> The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better.
> All three statements are true at the same time.

This article unpacks some of the challenge that we face when trying to
understand our deeply complex world. The reality is that there are terrible
things happening. _And_ that the world has improved significantly for many
people. _And_ there is more that we can do to make the world a better place.

## [Scotland's Forgotten Rainforest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-WUKT5hUo) by Aidin Robbins

This video takes an interesting look into the history of forests in Scotland. I
was impressed with the quality of the video and the detailed descriptions with
links to dive further into the topic. More creators should do that.

## [Music Map](https://music-map.com)

Finding new music is hard. Even when I try to learn into algorithmic
recommendations, I still find myself gravitating to the old bands and sounds
that I'm used to. Websites like Music Map can help by suggesting artists that
are similar to your favorite bands. I've used it to discover new music and
re-discover bands that I'd forgotten.
