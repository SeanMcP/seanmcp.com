I like trying out new browsers and try to avoid being tethered to one for too
long. But ever since its switch to Chromium, I find myself coming back to
Microsoft Edge.

1. **Powered by Chromium**: I have issues with recent releases of Chrome, but
   now that Edge is powered by the same underlying technology I don't need to
   choose.
2. **Size conscientious**: Screen real estate is precious, and Edge is the only
   cross-platform browser that cares about conserving it. The combination of
   vertical tabs and minimal UI makes it the clear winner for smaller screens.
3. **Customizable UI**: Chrome has started adding buttons to the toolbar that
   you can't remove. Edge allows you to decide what icons make sense for you.
4. **Unobtrusive AI**: I don't use Copilot features often, but it's there when I
   need it and out-of-the-way when I don't.
5. **DevTools improvements**: I like the vertical activity bar and the built-in
   accessibility checks.

If you haven't tried the new Edge, I recommend giving it a look.
