I'm trying something different with the formatting this week.

Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

## [Leaf letters: fan email for Melbourne's trees pours in from around the world](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/15/leaf-letters-fan-mail-melbourne-trees-pours-in-around-the-world) by Monica Tan (The Guardian)

Melbourne Australia registered email address for trees so that people could
report damages. Instead people sent kind messages:

> Hello, dear Tree. I read about this wonderful project and suppose to write you
> from another side of Earth - Russia. I hope you have a good care and donâ€™t
> sick. One day we will meet, may be.

I hope the same for you, dear reader.

## [Where did all the roaches go?](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/where-did-all-the-roaches-go) by Radio Atlantic via Search Engine

I wouldn't have thought that I would be recommending media about cockroaches,
but that's long-form narrative podcasting for you! Although it is billed as the
third part of a series on animals from the Search Engine podcast (which I
recommend), it's really an episode from Radio Atlantic (which I hadn't heard
of).

I'm too young to remember the cockroach days, but I remember lots of references
from my youth that didn't match reality. Pixar's Wall-E is a good example of the
lasting legacy of roaches in popular media.

## [One Year to Make a Game - Or Be a Janitor Forever - Devlog 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh9mhtEFUtg) by Wyrmyr Games

I'm a fan of the "Game Dev Log" genre on YouTube, and subscribe to a few
different channels. I don't have a passion for game development, but I
appreciate documenting the building process.

This particular video is a small creator who is trying to get into game
development while also working full-time as a cleaner. His fish-feeding
simulator idea is intriguing, and I hope that he is able to meet his goals.
