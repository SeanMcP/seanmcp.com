_Speed Catan_ is a variation of the popular board game _Catan_ that emphasizes
game speed and simplicity for younger (or impatient) players. Setup, game play,
and (most importantly) clean up are much faster.

It is played with a standard _Catan_ game with a few altered rules.

## Setup

Set out the terrain hexes (tiles) as usual. Do not place the circular number
tokens (chits) nor the sea frame pieces. Harbor pieces are optional.

Set the five resource and development cards in a row _in any order you choose_.
This is the **card list**. On your turn, the cards you draw will be based on
their number in the card list.

**Example**

> In order: 1) ore, 2) grain, 3) wool, 4) brick, 5) lumber, 6) development cards

## Rules

### Resources

On your turn, roll the two dice as usual. Each die "activates" the resource that
corresponds to the number in the card list. Draw the number of resources that
you produce of that type.

If the number corresponds to the development cards, then draw one.

**Example**

> Ezra rolls a 5 and a 6, which correspond to the lumber resource and
> development card. One of his settlements is touching two forests, so Ezra
> draws two lumber resources. Then he draws a single development card.

The rest of your turn proceeds as normal.

### Robber

Since you are no longer summing the dice when rolling, there is no way to
trigger the robber. You can either leave the piece in the box or set it in the
desert.

### Development cards

Development cards _can_ be played on the turn you bought it.

### Soldier (Knight) Cards

When you play a "Knight" development card, steal one resource card from the
player with the most victory points.

### Winning

There are two options for winning. Select one before starting the game:

1. Victory Points: The first player to acquire _x_ victory points wins.
   Considering playing to 10 like normal _Catan_ or fewer for a faster game.
2. Most By: The player with the most victory points in _x_ minutes wins.
   Consider capping the game to 10, 15, or 20 minutes.^[Better to play a short
   game twice than a long game once!]

**Example**

> The timer goes off after 15 minutes. Samuel, Ezra, and Sean total their
> victory points. Samuel has the most with 8 is the winner.
