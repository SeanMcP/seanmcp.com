Growth in Cairn is driven by the narrative and is not primarily mechanical.
[The overview](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/players-guide/overview-and-principles/)
words it this way: "Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining
new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming
obstacles."

Characters grow in status based on the things they have accomplished. They grow
in power through the relics they collect. They grow in experience as they
explore the world and its creatures. Throughout a campaign the characters may
change a lot even if their sheets do not.

The only mechanic for growth in Cairn are scars: damage that brings the
characters' hit protection to 0. Based on the amount of damage taken, characters
receive different scars that can affect their stats. For example, "rattling
blows" can increase your max HP while "reorienting head wounds" can improve
attributes.

This adds a level of excitement to combat encounters; at any point, your
character could grow while taking damage. But they are also few and far between.
In a twenty-session campaign I ran, a character only received two scars^[I faked
a third for narrative purposes, but that shouldn't count towards the total.]. Of
those, only one increased their stats.

For some players, that might be fine. The character grew in status in his
community, climbing from a lowly miner to a hero who was called upon to save the
village. But others might find the lack of mechanical growth demotivating. For
those players, I learned of a system from another game that might help.

## Failure-based attribute growth

I first saw this mechanic in
[Paradiso's prototype for a yet-unreleased game](https://youtu.be/0Konm0BcrEk)^[With
a crude name that I won't repeat here.], though the creator mentioned that he
got the idea from another system:

> For every failed save, add a tick mark next to that attribute. Once you
> receive ten ticks, then erase the marks and increment the attribute.

This is interesting for two reasons. First, it connects growth and failure in a
way that mirrors real life. We get better at things by trying them and failing
forward, like Edison's "10,000 ways that don't work". And second, it is self
balancing. Characters with low attributes will fail more often leading to more
growth. As that attribute increases, they will fail less often and growth slows.

Growth should be capped to 18, mirroring an optimal 3d6 attribute roll, and
scars maintaind for increasing hit protection. There are no other necessary rule
changes beyond that.

I haven't tried this hack, but I like it conceptually and believe that it could
work. The number of failures required to grow might need tweaked, and it might
be nice to have a section on the character sheet to track them.

If you do try the hack out, let me know what you think. I'm going to give it a
try the next campaign I run and will report back.
