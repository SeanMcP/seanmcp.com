In years past I have participated in Hacktoberfest. But I've found that the
t-shirt recently it isn't worth the effort as a contributor (to speak nothing of
the headache it is as a maintainer).

I'm used to doing _something_ special in October, so my curiousity was piqued
when I read about [#divtober](https://a.singlediv.com/divtober2023/) in
[Steph Eckles' _Modern CSS_ newsletter](https://moderncss.dev/). Instead of
spamming a bunch of maintainers with trivial PRs, you get to spam a single `div`
with a bunch of pseudo elements and box shadows. Neat!

So that's my goal for this month. Here is a some inspiration if you would like
to join the party: https://a.singlediv.com
