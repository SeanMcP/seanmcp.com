In 2021 I purchased a
[43" VIVO sit/stand desk](https://vivo-us.com/collections/most-popular-standing-desks/products/desk-kit-b04b?variant=33285162795107)
from Amazon. It has served me well for the last few years, but I have
encountered a few issues and solutions that I want to log here.

## Desktop rocks back and forth

When the allen bolts that hold the desktop to the frame are too loose, then the
desktop will rock back and forth with normal use. This is particularly
noticeable when you are leaning on the desk, but also when writing or typing.

To fix this, I've found that tightening the bolts with an allen wrench prevents
the rocking. However, over-tightening results in the paint chipping around the
bolt holes and slight deformations of the metal. Be careful and only tighten as
much as necessary.

## Desktop squeaks under pressure

This one was maddening: whenever I applied the slightest pressure on the desktop
it would squeak. Some days it was so bad that every keystroke prompted a small
squeak.

Loosening the allen bolts that hold the desktop to the frame fixed this issue
but caused the rocking issue mentioned above.

To fix this, I purchased nylon washers from the hardware store and placed them
in-between the frame and the brackets holding the desktop[^1]. With those in
place the the allen bolts tightened, the squeaking has stopped.

## Modifications

- Added an
  [IKEA Signum cable organizer](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/signum-cable-management-horizontal-silver-color-30200253/)
  to the bottom of the desktop
- Added a generic clear acrylic headphone hanger to the bottom of the desktop

[^1]: Don't be like me: make sure to clear the desktop before you do this
