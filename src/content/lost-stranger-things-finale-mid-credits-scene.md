I was startled on the evening of December 31, 2025 by a knock on the door. Being
too late for visitors, I investigated slowly and peered outside. Light snow
floated in the air, filling a set of retreating footsteps. On the doorstep I
found a envelope addressed 'To Whom It May Concern' in scarlet ink. I have
transcribed the contents below.

**INT. AIRPORT - DAY**

Someone hands papers to a ticket AGENT. The agent looks at the ticket.

<center>AGENT</center>
<in-dent>

Oh, Iceland is beautiful. Have you been before?

</in-dent>

MIKE stands before the ticket desk wearing glasses and shouldering a backpack.

<center>MIKE</center>
<in-dent>

No, first time.

</in-dent>

<center>AGENT</center>
<in-dent>

<center>(Looking through paperwork)</center>

I'm sure you'll love it Mr...

</in-dent>

The driver's license has Mike's photo but the name 'Snorri Snurluson'.

<center>AGENT (V.O.)</center>
<in-dent>

Snore-lou-son.

</in-dent>

The agent completes a task slowly on the computer.

<center>AGENT</center>
<in-dent>

<center>(A little absent-mindedly)</center>

Are you heading home or traveling for work?

</in-dent>

<center>MIKE</center>
<in-dent>

<center>(With a subtle smile)</center>

Visiting a friend.

</in-dent>

The agent returns the papers, and Mike walks off down the tunnel.
