The five-room dungeon framework was designed by
[Johnn Four of Roleplaying Tips](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/author/johnn-four/)
as a way to combine mythic story structure and quick/easy adventure design[^1].
The framework is simple and flexible; it works for any setting and system, and
can be used for one-shot adventures or as part of a larger campaign.

The framework is popular because it "satisfies a dungeon crawling experience as
well as an adventure's narrative"[^3] and "includes all the main ingredients of
a fun, fantasy adventure... combat, exploration, and social interaction."[^2]

## The five rooms

1. **Room One: Entrance and Guardian**: An early encounter that explains why the
   dungeon has remains unexplored and hooks the players into the adventure.
2. **Room Two: Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge**: A different kind of challenge
   than room one that requires the players to use their brains or social skills.
3. **Room Three: Trick or Setback**: After victories in rooms one and two, this
   room builds tension by introducing an issue that puts success into doubt.
4. **Room Four: Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict**: The big showdown that tests
   the players' skills, resources, and problem-solving abilities.
5. **Room Five: Reward, Revelation, Plot Twist**: The final room provides the GM
   an opportunity to provide a reward, reveal a secret, or introduce a twist
   that sets up the next adventure.

Put another way, the rooms are an "Entrance, Puzzle, Setback, Battle, and
Reward"[^3] though the exact order can be changed[^1][^2]. Rooms one and two are
popular choices for swapping[^1], but you could alternatively introduce passages
or secret doors that allow the players to move freely between rooms[^2] or a
non-linear layout that invites the players to explore and double back[^5].

It is important to note that the framework of a "five-room dungeon" can be used
in settings other than dungeons[^1][^2][^5]. You can think of the rooms in the
framework as scenes in a story, or narrative touch-points[^3], that could be set
in a town, hideout, forest, ship, or any other location.

## Beyond five rooms

Justin Alexander, in his book _So You Want To Be A Game Master_, proposes a
variation of the five-room dungeon that he calls "5+5 Dungeons".[^4] These
contain five featured rooms and five scenic rooms, the former focused on action
and the latter on setting and story.

Alexander's five featured rooms should comprise:

1. A challenge
2. A fight
3. A twist
4. A reward
5. A second challenge, fight, twist, or reward

The order of these featured rooms is less important, and the interspersed scenic
rooms can be used to weave the rooms together into a cohesive and interesting
adventure.

An alternative option is to link multiple sets of five rooms into a larger and
more complex dungeon. This could be "mini dungeons" with distinct themes that
are linked together or multiple levels of a larger dungeon. Let the five-room
dungeon be the starting point and grow from there.

## Other improvements

Baron de Ropp suggests improving the five-room dungeon by working the elements
to a traditional three-act story structure and gives some examples of what that
should look like[^3]. Map Crow suggests designing the dungeon in reverse,
starting with the boss and then planning a secret, a gauntlet path, a "thinky
room", and the entrance guard[^6].
