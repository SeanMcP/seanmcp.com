Khan Academy celebrates Global Accessibility Awareness Day with a whole week of
activities. Yesterday on GAAD proper, we were encouraged to set aside our normal
work and pick up some accessibility tasks from the backlog or do some
a11y-focused professional development.

They also hosted four accessibility lightning talks, and I was happy to give one
on a11y tools built into modern web browser. The talk consisted of quick tours
through Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari that highlighted some of their
accessibility features.

I enjoy preparing presentations about the browser dev tools because it is a
perfect excuse for me to learn more about the tools that I have at my disposal.
Some of the cool new features that I learned about were:

- **Vision-deficiency emulators** in Chrome (Rendering tab) and Firefox
  (Accessibility panel)
- **Interactive accessibility trees** in Firefox (Accessibility panel) and
  Chrome (experimental - Inspect panel)
- **Targeted accessibility audits** in Firefox (Accessibility panel) and Safari
  (Audit panel)
- **Visualized tab order** in Firefox (Accessibility panel)
- **Automatic Axe scans** in Edge (Issues tab)

The recording is private, but my outline for the talk is available at
[/talks/browser-a11y-tools/](/talks/browser-a11y-tools). I might re-record the
talk for [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@seanmcp), so subscribe if youâ€™re so
inclined.

Overall, its encouraging to see all of the major browsers putting time and
effort into creating tools to help developers built accessible applications. Now
we all just need to use them!
