This morning my son asked me "If our last name is McPherson, why do people
always call us McPhearson?"

"I don't know," I replied. Besides the "Mc" there are no tricks; the
pronunciation follows the standard English reading rules.

<img alt="Meme: Phoebe teaches Joey how to pronounce 'er', 'her', and 'pher' and then asks him how to pronounce 'McPherson'. He confidently responds with the incorrect 'McPhearson'" src="/img/phoebe-teaches-joey-mcpherson.jpg" style="width:min(100%, 600px)">

I know that text on a page is not the best medium for a pronunciation guide (at
least until we all learn
[IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)), so here's
a read aloud:
