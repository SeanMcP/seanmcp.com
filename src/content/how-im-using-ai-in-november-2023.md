AI products/services that I used regularly (multiple times per week):

- **GitHub Copilot** ⭐: Copilot continues to be a valuable resource when
  coding.
- **Chat GPT**: I signed up for the paid version and spent a lot of time working
  with custom GPTs. Not sure that the service is worth the price, especially
  with rate limits, but I'm viewing it as professional development.
- **Khanmigo** 📈: I now work on a AI-product that is powered by Khanmigo daily.

AI Products/services that I used occasionally (once per week or less):

- **Dall-E** 📈: I played around with image generation in the context of custom
  GPTs.
- **Warp**: I probably use this feature once a week to help with a command that
  I know exists but can’t remember.

AI products/services that I have access to but did not use:

- **Bard**
- **Bing**
- **Claude**
- **Cursor** 📉
- **MDN**
- **Notion**
