In the last session I ran, my players found a mask that turns the wearer into
stone^[I was inspired by the
[_Book of Masks_](https://geolith-games.itch.io/book-of-masks) zine and _The
Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_]. At least they _think_ that's how it works.
They were too afraid to test it on each other. One of them pocketed it and the
group continued on the adventure.

Later the group was fighting a few goblins when one player remembered the mask.
She asked "Can I try to sneak behind these crates and slip the mask on the
goblin?" That seemed possible given the circumstances, so I set a normal
difficulty class (12 in Shadowdark) and had her roll. She failed and was
noticeably disappointed before returning to combat.

In the moment I knew I messed up, and after reflecting I think I know why. She
was trying to explore the world that we were creating together. That is
something that GM's want to encourage; it's what makes collaborative
storytelling fun.

When I made my decision to ask for a roll, I was thinking about _what_ she was
trying to do. I made reasonable judgment based on that. But I should have
considered _why_.

She had received a magic item and didn't know how it worked. She was looking for
answers. The scenario just happened to be a small skirmish with goblins. If I
had the _why_ in mind, I would have realized that this was a perfect opportunity
for low-stakes exploration.

Turning one goblin into stone temporarily would have little impact on the
encounter and no impact on the adventure. But the information gained could be
huge. The players' minds would be racing with ideas of how to use the mask again
in the future:

- "Am I heavier/denser with the mask on?"
- "How do I feel when I take it off?"
- "Could we put it on before getting hit to reduce damage?"
- "Oo, what if we slipped it on the big bad guy while he's monologuing?"

Exploration expands the world and opportunities to interact within. It is an
objective good that GM's should seek to encourage. **If a player wants to
explore and the stakes are low, then let them do it.**

I should have let her succeed on the first goblin without a roll. I'd describe
the goblin's reaction as it turned to stone and then let the players think
through the possibilities. If and when she attempts to use the mask again, then
I set a difficulty class and ask for a roll.
