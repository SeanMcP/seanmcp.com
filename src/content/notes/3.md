Each note is a simple markdown file. All the data necessary to render on the screen is set at a higher level, so it's super simple.

**Edit**: Okay, I needed to add a date field.

My favorite part of this setup is that I can commit a new note through GitHub, which automatically triggers a Netlify build.
