[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) doesn't run pre- and post-scripts by default. You need to explicitly enable this behavior by [configuring `enable-pre-post-scripts`](https://pnpm.io/cli/run#enable-pre-post-scripts):

```shell
pnpm config set enable-pre-post-scripts true
```

This updates the [local or global pnpm config file](https://pnpm.io/cli/config).

You can [read more about pnpm's decision](https://pnpm.io/cli/run#differences-with-npm-run).
