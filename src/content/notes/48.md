There was an interesting Slack thread at work today discussing how to meet and
make friends as an adult. A lot of folks chimed in and shared their experience
and some things that have worked for them.

As a Christian who is active in a church community, I've never encountered these
challenges. But I'm empathetic towards those who have: meaningful in-person
relationships are necessary and increasingly difficult to find.
