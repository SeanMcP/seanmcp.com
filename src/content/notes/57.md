After a four-month hiatus, I got my website running on Windows again.
[The `runtime: out of memory` error that I encountered](https://github.com/withastro/compiler/issues/761)
went away after I installed a larger solid-state drive.

I'm glad to have the issue resolved, but it's crazy to me that **memory** could
be the reason why a static-site generator falls over. I guess this is the world
that we live and work in now.
