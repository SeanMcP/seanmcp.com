I created a [Threads](https://threads.net) account yesterday in the ongoing
pursuit of finding a Twitter-like experience that is a net positive for me. The
app looks neat and works fine, but there are two big issues:

1. There is no way to surface content from non-verified users (_i.e._ normal
   people)
2. There is no way to view only posts from accounts you follow

In its current iteration, Threads is an app for eavesdropping on Instagram
influences, celebrities, and brands.

I don't see how that provides lasting value to most people after the launch
excitement fades.
