For a long time I avoided using the `.mjs` extension with Node.js because it
felt odd. But after years of fiddling with package `type`s and CLI arguments to
get it to run ES Modules, I've come around to "Michael Jackson Script".

I'm looking forward to the day when ESM are the default in Node.js, but until
then: _viva la `.mjs`_.
