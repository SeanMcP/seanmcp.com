Today I added Netlify CMS to the site in order to make it easier to add [notes](/notes). I may expand the feature for articles in the future.

The most difficult part of the process was the limited control over file slugs. Notes are numbered and incremented, but there wasn't a good way to do that with Netlify CMS without adding a new field. Oh well. Hopefully the ease of use will trump the annoyance of unnecessary data.
