title: Four perspectives on AI
description: >-
  I respond to Maxi Ferreira's thesis on the two stages of AI adoption among
  developers with a four-quadrant model based on an individual's beliefs about
  AI. These gives us four perspectives: Skeptical, Wary, Pragmatic, and
  Optimistic.

[Maxi Ferreira writes in _Fear and Curiosity and AI_](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/46)
about the two stages of AI adoption among developers:

> A Stage 1 reaction looks something like this: “Ha! Look at this dumb mistake

> Components. More like Artificial Unintelligence, am I right? Good luck taking

The naming suggestions a progression. Developers start at the defensive/fearful
Stage 1 but are able to progress to Stage 2 with a "curiosity mindset".

I agree with Ferreira about the two reactions. I feel like I've heard them both
near verbatim while talking about AI with colleagues. And I agree that curiosity
and a growth mindset are invaluable in our field and life broadly. But the
framing of "Stage 1/Stage 2" and the motivation behind them is uncharitable (at
best) and unhelpful (at worst).^[Despite my disagreement with Ferreira, I still
recommend [his newsletter](https://frontendatscale.com/). It has helpful
insights and interesting links that I'm happy to see in my inbox.]

The difference between the two reactions depends not on time and mindset but on
an individual's belief of AI's transformative potential and positive impact.

<img src="/img/beliefs-about-ai.png" alt="A two-axis graph labeled 'Beliefs about AI' with the x-axis of 'Transformative' and the y-axis of 'Positive'. The field is divided into four quadrants: 'Skeptical' in the bottom-left, 'Wary' in the bottom-right, 'Pragmatist' in the top-left, and 'Optimist' in the top-right.">

The **Skeptical** see AI's capabilities and limitations. They question the
imminent advent of AGI and whether future frontier models will have a
significant impact on the world in the long-term. They don't see the
technological developments of AI as a net positive. They'll use phrases like
"over-hyped" and "flash in the pan". They are unlikely to experiment with AI
tools. When they see the output of any-given model, they tend to have Reaction 1
because criticism illustrates their beliefs.

The **Wary** also see AI's capabilities and limitations but believe that
developments in the field will result in dramatic changes to our work and lives.
They are concerned that the advancement of this technology will come at severe
cost to other aspects of our world. They'll have a "p(doom)" number, raise
concerns about safety, and cite environmental or societal detriments of AI. They
may have Reaction 1 but are more likely to avoid AI entirely and encourage
others to do the same.

The **Pragmatic** aren't swayed by arguments for or projections of AGI. They see
AI as a tool to help them with tasks today. They'll experiment with prompts and
models but will quickly move on when it isn't working. They'll mention
"usefulness", "utility", and "productivity". They spend little time thinking
about AI beyond a specific problem and solution. They may have Reaction 2,
though there will be a reasonable time box for how long they explore.

The **Optimistic** see the potential in AI's capabilities and trust that the
limitations will eventually be overcome. They believe that future models will
radically transform our world for the better citing problems to be solved in
medicine and the environment. They'll encourage others to learn how to use AI so
that they "don't get left behind". They tend to have Reaction 2 and will push
the boundaries of what is capable with the current state of AI.

I've grouped these four perspectives, but everything here is a spectrum.
Depending on the context or day, you might find yourself at any point on the
graph. And I've attempted to describe each perspectively generously, because I
don't believe that any are inherently good or bad. I find myself switching
between perspectives throughout the day as I implement features, use tools, and
read articles. A good team is probably made of members from all perspectives.

Which perspective resonates with you today? Do you also find yourself moving
around the graph?
[I would love to hear your thoughts](mailto:sean@seanmcp.com?subject=RE:%20Four%20perspectives%20on%20AI),
as I'm sure mine will continue to develop over time.
