My three-year-old son _really_ likes Boston Dynamics videos. He frequently
requests to watch them and will parade around the house as Spot, Atlas, or
Stretch/Handle. As far as little kid fixations on machines go, I think robots
are a pretty cool option; he's much more likely to work on/with robots in the
future than steam engines!

One video he likes is
[_Spot Launch_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlkCQXHEgjA), which features the
titular robot navigating through a bunch of simulated work environments. It's an
entertaining video, and my son really likes dancing to the song.

The song wasn't listed in the video description, and I couldn't find an answer
via a Google search. I did find
[two unanswered](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/comments/isqmyu/what_is_the_song_in_the_spot_launch_ad_from/)
and
[archived questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/d9fn4j/help_identifying_song_from_spot_launch_boston/)
on Reddit asking for help identifying the song.

With my wife's help, I tried using the
[Google app's music recognition feature](https://blog.google/products/search/hum-to-search/).
I played the YouTube video on my phone, and she let the app listen on hers.
Within 5 seconds, Google had identified the song as
[_Banana_ by Stony Pony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZaAmapkp4Q). Neat!

Here are the two videos for comparison:

The version in the Boston Dynamics video has removed the word "Banana" a few
times, but it is otherwise the same song.

It's too late to answer those Reddit questions, but I added
[a comment to the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlkCQXHEgjA&lc=UgwqRUzrTpMJJlVCMQt4AaABAg).
And hopefully the next person searching stumbles upon that or this article.

Happy listening!
