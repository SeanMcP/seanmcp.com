I don't where I saw a recommendation for [Maccy](https://maccy.app/), but I owe
them a big thank you. It's a simple clipboard manager for Mac that takes the
headache out of copying and pasting.

Once it's installed, use copy and paste like normal. But when you want to dig
into your clipboard history, you can open Maccy with the keyboard shortcut. Mine
is:

<p style="text-align: center;">
<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
</p>

A pop up shows you a searchable list of items that you've copied in
reverse-chronological order. Selecting an item adds it back to your clipboard.

Maccy also remembers images, which is useful when taking screenshots of your
work. Snap a few pictures and then retrieve them from Maccy when filling out
your pull request or Slack message. It's handy when managing multiple git
branches too. I can quickly retrieve a branch from memory when pulling, merging,
or rebasing.

[It looks like macOS 26 will add clipboard history to Spotlight](https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/10/macos-26-spotlight-gets-actions-clipboard-manager-custom-shortcuts/)^[Hopefully
it doesn't become
[another case of _sherlocking_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)#Sherlocked_as_a_term>)
from Cuppertino.], but we'll see if the implementation works as well as Maccy.
