Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[_What's inside this crater in Madagascar?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h42QVfrUVFw)
   by Vox**<br/>Vox teams up with local reporters to find out who is living
   inside a remote volcanic crater in a rural part of Madagascar. An interesting
   story that is well told.

2. **[_Parkinson's Law_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)
   (Wikipedia)**<br/>This week I was reminded of Parkinson's Law, which states
   that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." The
   Wikipedia article has some interesting information, including corollaries and
   a formula. For a more practical explanation, checkout:
   [_What is Parkinson's Law?_](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-parkinsons-law-6674423)

3. **[FutureMe: Write a Letter to your Future Self](https://www.futureme.org/)**<br/>[Multiple commenters on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39274004)
   mentioned using the service every year on their birthday. That seems like an
   interesting practice (especially since my birthday is coming up soon).

4. **[Shark Tracker](https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/) by OCEARCH**<br/>In a
   similar vein to [the lightning tracker from #2](/articles/a-few-things-2),
   here is a live world map of tagged sharks tagged by researchers. This will be
   fascinating or terrifying depending on your feelings about sharks.
