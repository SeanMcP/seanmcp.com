I like the _idea_ of digital gardens, but I haven't been happy with how I
implemented them on my site. This afternoon as I was thinking about it,
inspiration struck and I redesigned how I illustrate a historical record of
tended dates.

Instead of a verbose list of "Planted on...", "Tended X times", and "Last
tended...", it is now two dates and a visualization representing the number of
intermediary dates. You can see how this looks for gardens in different states
on [/gardens](/gardens).

Check it out and let me know what you think.
