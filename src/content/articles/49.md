My wife has informed me that "Up the INSERT_NOUN" is not a common phrase. I
first heard it in my
[folk-punk days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeBpMVSSuvQ), and I had assumed
that it was more common. Live and learn!

**Update**: She has since told me that she thought it sounded like a vulgarity.
