Thanks to Netlify Analytics I know to focus on writing how-to articles, but it has less data than I hoped.

**Some context:** Netlify provides analytics information for $9 per month per site. They offer data from server requests including page views, unique visitors, top locations, and sources.

- [The data varies greatly](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/) from client-side options like Google Analytics

**The numbers:**

- My site received **38,000** page views from **13,000** unique visitors in the last 30 days
- The top location was the **United States**, followed distantly by Germany, France, and China
- The most popular page was a tool for [looking up words by consonant-vowel patterns](https://www.seanmcp.com/articles/english-words-by-consonant-vowel-pattern/)
- The most popular content were **how-to articles**

**Trade-offs:** Netlify Analytics was easy to set up with an existing project — just one click after adding payment information. But it lacks comprehensive data for informed decision making.

- I want to know how all of my pages are performing, but Netlify’s dashboard limits you to 15 results.
- The inclusion of bot traffic add uncertainty to the numbers.

**Takeaway:** People are visiting this site for guides on completing a particular task. These are broken down into two categories: tutorials and debugging.

- In order to create value for my readers, I’m going to focus this area
- I expect more for $9/month and probably won’t continue the subscription
