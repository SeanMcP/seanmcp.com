In doing research on debugging, I've found [Diomidis Spinellis' _Effective Debugging_](https://www.spinellis.gr/debugging/) to be really insightful. It's chock-full of helpful tips and real-world examples that illustrate the recommendations well.

If you are looking for a general book on debugging, then I highly recommend it.
