This feels like the breakthrough month. I moved to a new project at Khan Academy working on AI, and I found myself reaching for AI-powered tools more frequently throughout October. I can see a future where I use some of these daily.

AI products/services that I used regularly (multiple times per week):

- **GitHub Copilot**¬†‚≠ê: Copilot continues to be a valuable resource when coding.
- **Chat GPT** üìà: I don‚Äôt know if the quality of the answers changed or I just had better questions to ask, but I found myself using it regularly this month.

AI Products/services that I used occasionally (once per week or less):

- **Cursor**: A VS-Code-like editor with ChatGPT built in. I used it once while pairing with a coworker and it was neat.
- **Warp**: Same as last update, I probably use this feature once a week to help with a command that I know exists but can‚Äôt remember.

AI products/services that I have access to but did not use:

- **Bard**
- **Bing**
- **Claude**
- **Khanmigo**
- **Dall-E**
- **MDN**
- **Notion**
