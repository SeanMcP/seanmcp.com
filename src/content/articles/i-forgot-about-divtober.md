On October 10th, I boldly claimed that completing #divtober was "my goal for
this month."
[In the words of Maury](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/maury-lie-detector), that
was a lie.

I thought about whipping something up just for this article, but I'm not going
to do that either. So here is an RSS Club article to let you, dear reader, down
easy.

Maybe next year! (But don't quote me on that.)
