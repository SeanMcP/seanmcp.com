  Programming has been my hobby since 2017, but I'm looking for a complementary
  hobby to encourage creativity instead of consumption

Since changing careers in 2017, programming has been by creative outlet. I enjoy
coding in the early mornings before the rest of the family is awake, in the
evenings when the kids are in bed, and on Saturdays when I have some downtime.

In general, I think this hobby interest in programming has been a help to my
career as a software engineer. But occasionally my passion for it wanes, and it
can have a negative impact on my drive at work. I don’t want my creative outlet
and job to be _too_ closely connected.

When I’m feeling disinterested in my creative outlet, my default is to go to
consumption: watching YouTube videos and playing video games. And rarely do I
feel _good_ about my decisions after doing that for a long stretch of time.

So I’d like to find a new hobby for those times when programming is unappealing.
Something simple that I can pick up and put down whenever. Preferably something
offline and low tech. When I was a kid I was interested in drawing (my first
career choice was an illustrator), so maybe that is a good option option to
pursue. Plus it’s a good activity to do with little children.

I want to cultivate more opportunities to create as opposed to consume. Any
suggestions?
