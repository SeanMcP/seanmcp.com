I used [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/) to create my slides for my recent talk at
Pittsburgh TechFest 2023. I've previously used Google Slides--which is a great
option--but I've been interested in finding a good tool for creating slides from
Markdown.

There were two main motivations for this:

1. I want the content of the slides to be easier to edit and share.
2. I want to spend less time fiddling with the design of the slides and more
   time on the content.

The main reason to move away from Google Slides is productivity. I find it
incredibly easy to sink tons of prep time into designing slides. It provides a
perfect opportunity to procrastinate when I really need to be working on the
content of the talk.

## Pros

- **Design**: The default designs are high-quality enough that I didn't feel the
  need to customize them to make it look nice.
- **Presenter mode**: I think this worked better than Google Slides. The ability
  to edit content and comments from presenter mode was really useful when
  prepping.
- **Markdown**: It was really nice to be able to "markup" my slides and comments
  with Markdown like bold, italics, and code blocks. That feels like that is
  pre-requisite for any dev slides now.
- **VS Code extension**: I didn't use it much, but it was a nice option to have.

## Cons

- **Formatting**: I couldn't figure out how to get the VS Code formatter working
  correctly. If I accidentally hit the format shortcut (which is a reflex of
  mine), it broke all of the slides with frontmatter.
- **Slide images**: Slidev has nice options for decorative images with layouts,
  but I couldn't figure out how to position content images correctly. A single
  centered image was fine, but if you wanted to have an image beside text then
  it was more difficult.

## Conclusion

Overall I was happy with Slidev, and I think I will use it again for future
slide decks.
