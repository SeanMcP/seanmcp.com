The burrito emoji, aka 🌯 aka `:burrito:`, means thank you. Why a burrito? In the words of [a former colleague](https://daniel-salmon.com/):

> Would you rather hear someone say “thanks”, or someone give you a burrito?

His logic was unassailable!

Examples:

> Sarah: Here’s that doc you were looking for: https://example.com/doc
>
> Raul: 🌯

> Eleanor: @Wilson 🌯 for the help in that meeting

🌯 for reading!
