Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[From-To](https://from-to.app/) by Franz Labs**<br/>From-To is an app that
   helps you understand a city that you're visiting by comparing it to a city
   that you already know. Later this year, my wife and I are planning a trip to
   Colorado Springs, but we've never been to Colorado before. Using From-To, I
   can compare Springs to our hometown of Pittsburgh to see what neighborhoods
   are similar. Definitely worth bookmarking for your next trip. (h/t

2. **[_GovDocs to the Rescue! Debunking an Immigration Myth_](https://journals.ala.org/index.php/dttp/article/view/6655/8939)
   by Rosemary Meszaros and Katherine Pennavaria**<br/>Here in the United
   States, it is very common to hear that a family's name was changed at Ellis
   Island. But researchers Meszaros and Pennavaria have dispelled the myth by
   comparing government records before and after visiting Ellis Island. They
   found that these records "demonstrate conclusively that immigrants left Ellis
   Island with the same surnames they had arrived with." (h/t

3. **[_The glassmith tactic_](https://www.ggnotes.com/the-glassmith-tactic/) by
   Greg Gilbert**<br/>AI and Large Language Models will change content creation
   forever. Instead of competing with the machine, Gilbert suggests looking to
   artisans for inspiration. "The [glassblowers] didn't merely sell you a vase.
   No, they sold you a vase and a story."

4. **[_Starcatcher_](https://escada-games.itch.io/starcatcher) by Escada
   Games**<br/>Starcatcher is a little browser based game where you play as an
   astronaut trying to collect stars on chunks of space debris. The trick is
   that gravity changes based on where you character is facing, which makes it a
   challenging and mind-bending experience.
