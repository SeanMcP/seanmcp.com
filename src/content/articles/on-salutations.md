title: On salutations
description:
  Saluations are lovely in letters but unnecessary online. I'm going to try to
  omit salutations from my articles.

I have historically ended all of my articles with a salutation like “Happy
coding!” or “Happy debugging!”. Recently I tried a Lewis-inspired “Onward and
upward!” and [the controversial “Up the web!”](/notes/49).

I picked up the practice back when
[I was blogging my way through coding bootcamp](https://medium.com/@seanmcp/js-basics-functions-23637174f4f).
I’m not sure where I picked it up; probably something that I
noticed other writers doing as I tried to find my own style.

But on further reflection, I’m don’t think that a salutation is necessary
online. And the amount of time I have spent thinking of the best gerund to
follow “Happy” is not negligible. Instead, I could better use that time refining
the conclusion.

Going forward, once I have made my point I will end the article.
