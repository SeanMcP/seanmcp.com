title: On closings
description:
  Closings are lovely in letters but unnecessary online. I'm going to try to
  omit closings from my articles.

**Update**: I misused the term “salutation” in this article. What I meant was
[apparently "valedictions" or "closings"](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/51792/what-term-is-used-for-the-closing-of-a-letter).
I've updated the article below to reflect this, but the permalink will remain
the same.

I have historically ended all of my articles with a closing like “Happy coding!”
or “Happy debugging!”. Recently I tried a Lewis-inspired “Onward and upward!”
and [the controversial “Up the web!”](/notes/49).

I picked up the practice back when
[I was blogging my way through coding bootcamp](https://medium.com/@seanmcp/js-basics-functions-23637174f4f).
I’m not sure where I picked it up; probably something that I noticed other
writers doing as I tried to find my own style.

But on further reflection, I’m don’t think that a closing is necessary online.
And the amount of time I have spent thinking of the best gerund to follow
“Happy” is not negligible. Instead, I could better use that time refining the
conclusion.

Going forward, once I have made my point I will end the article.
