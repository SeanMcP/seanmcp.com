I signed up for a Behance account today and needed to complete the worst
captcha[^1] that I have ever experienced:

<img alt="A captcha with pictures of a number and a pile of dice that you are required to sum" src="/img/adobe-captcha.png" height="400" style="display:block;margin-inline:auto;" />

Adobe presents you with the image of a number and a picture of a pile of dice.
You are required to find sum the dice and then compare it to the number. That is
painful enough, but not out of bounds for captchas.

The worst part is that you are presented with **12 pictures of dice** and you
need to find the sum of every one. Doing that once would be annoying, but you
are required to complete the task **10 times**.

So in order verify that you are a human, Adobe requires that you find the sum of
up to **120 pictures of dice**. **120!** Absurd.

(The audio captcha was similarly bad, but I didn't have the patience to work
through all of the audio clips required for one step of the task. So save that
review for later.)

I understand the need for captchas, but this is exceptionally bad. We need to
find a better balance between security and user experience. Whatever the
solution is, this is definitely not it.

[^1]:
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) uses CAPTCHA because it
    is an acronym, but I don't want to shout.
