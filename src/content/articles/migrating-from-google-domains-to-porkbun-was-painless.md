**Painless**. They charged a fee of around $11.00 US to transfer the domain and
then handled the rest seamlessly.

I was hesitant to make the switch off of Google/Squarespace because I didn‚Äôt
know how involved the process would be. I only had two domains on Google, but
there was never a good time to encounter and address downtime issues during a
transfer.

Thankfully, there weren‚Äôt any. I transferred a low-stakes domain first, and from
start to finish it took around 15 minutes. It went so smoothly that I repeated
the process with [seanmcp.com](http://seanmcp.com) with the same results.

Thank you Google Domains for providing a good service and for facilitating an
easy transition. And thank you Porkbun for being a fun alternative. I look
forward to many years of service from a dedicated registrar. <e-moji>üê∑</e-moji>
