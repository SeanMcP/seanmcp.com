series: How I Use AI

As of May 2023, I use the following AI-powered products on at least a weekly
basis:

- GitHub Copilot ‚≠ê
  - **Writing code**: typically this is autocomplete to the end of the line, but
    occasionally it generates small blocks of code. Rarely I use it to generate
    a Regex for a particular pattern, saving me a search, copy, and paste from
    StackOverflow.
- ChatGPT
  - **Conversations**: the best for prompt engineering, it runs with a persona that
    you give it. I‚Äôve found rubber-duck sessions with a ‚Äúhelpful coworker who
    asks insightful questions‚Äù to be really helpful.
  - **Generating structured code**: creates a list of ten objects that match a given
    structure.
  - **Document drafting**: I needed to write a charter for a church building
    committee and had no clue where to start. A few prompts to ChatGPT, and I
    had an outline and draft to follow.
- Bing
  - **Internet searches**: if I have a question that would typically require more
    than one search, then I‚Äôll ask Bing. It does a good job of
    answering _with_ citations.
  - **Summarizing content**: given a URL, Bing does a good job of summarizing
    content from a web page. You can even ask for comprehension questions if
    you‚Äôre reading to learn.
- Bard üìà
  - **Coding questions**: Bard gives the right balance of length and depth for
    questions I have about programming. It usually includes helpful code
    snippets.
- Warp
  - **Command suggestions**: saves a lot of time searching for those common commands
    that you can never seem to remember, _e.g._ ‚Äúhow to undo the last
    commit?‚Äù

As of May 2023, I have access to but no interest in the following products:

- **Midjourney/Dall¬∑E/Bing Images**: I‚Äôve seen some of the things they generate, and
  while some of it is cool none of it feels useful to me.
- **Notion**: I don‚Äôt need an AI to write content for me.
