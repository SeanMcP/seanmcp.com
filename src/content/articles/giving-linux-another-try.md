title: Giving Linux another try
description:
  It's been about 10 years since I last tried using Linux, so I think it's time
  to explore what it has to offer in 2022.

I felt inspired by
[an article by Hey Homepage](https://www.heyhomepage.com/?module=blog&link=1&post=4)
and recent [episode of The Changelog podcast](https://pca.st/3ypvfdke) to give
Linux another try. This description just sounds so nice:

> For over a year now, I use a Raspberry Pi 4 (with 8GB of RAM) as my daily
> desktop computer. I browse the internet, read and send e-mails, program
> software, edit photos, create images, watch Youtube videos and play games on
> it. Without any significant problems.

So tonight I'm dusting off the ol' Raspberry Pi and trying a fresh installation
of Ubuntu Mate. Why Mate? Because it was recommended in the article above. The
latest time I needed a low-powered Ubuntu flavor I used Lubuntu, but that is
probably 10 years ago. Time flies!

I don't expect to completely change my computing habits; as a front-end focused
developer I feel pretty compelled to stick with macOS. But I'm looking forward
to peeking outside of the Apple ecosystem, even in a sandbox, to get a better
picture of the world out there in 2022.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions, because I don't know what I'm
doing. ðŸ˜„
