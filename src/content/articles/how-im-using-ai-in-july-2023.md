AI products/services that I used regularly (multiple times per week):

- **GitHub Copilot** ⭐: Copilot continues to be a valuable resource when
  coding. I was working on a script while offline, and I missed seeing it's
  suggestions.

AI Products/services that I used occasionally (once per week or less):

- **Bing Images** & **ChatGPT**: I used these for a small project (creating a
  fantasy RPG to play with my kids), but it didn't end up going anywhere.
- **Khanmigo**: Khan Academy has their own AI offering that I have access to
  through work. It's neat, but I'm not convinced how useful it is for the
  average user.
- **MDN**: MDN launched a new AI-powered search feature that I tried a few
  times. The results weren't great: nothing for information that should have
  been easy to find, and some incorrect answers. But I can see potential in
  something like that.

AI products/services that I have access to but did not use:

- **Bard** 📉
- **Bing** 📉
- **Dall-E**
- **Notion**
- **Warp** 📉
