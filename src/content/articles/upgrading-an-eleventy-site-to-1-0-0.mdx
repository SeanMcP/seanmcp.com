I initially published a [note](/notes) about how easy it was to upgrade to Eleventy `1.0.0`, but I hit a snag which warrants a quick article. Here are the two steps that I needed to complete to update this website to the latest version of Eleventy.

First, update `@11ty/eleventy` with the following command:

```shell
npm i -D @11ty/eleventy@latest
```

After updating that, both the `start` and `build` scripts for the site worked as expected. [There are breaking changes to be aware of](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v1.0.0), so your mileage may vary.

I took the time to update some other dependencies and pushed the changes to GitHub. I have the repo connected to Netlify for CI/CD, which usually works without a hitch. Today, however, I noticed that the build failed with the following log:

```

```

There weren't any build configurations in Netlify for Node.js version, but a quick search led me to [this guide on managing build dependencies](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript). Good documentation; another reason to use Netlify!

I added an environment variable for `NODE_VERSION` and set it to the current Node.js LTS (`16.13.2` as of writing), and the build was successful.

Regardless of your setup, just make sure that you are using Node.js version `12` or later and you should be good to go. <Emoji symbol="ðŸš€" />

Happy upgrading!
