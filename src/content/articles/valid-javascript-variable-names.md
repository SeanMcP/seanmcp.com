I’ve been working on a little library to help build little JavaScript applications. Something to fill the gap for me between little scripts and reaching for a framework like Svelte.

While designing the API, I’ve found myself searching for obscure but technically valid JS variable names to distinguish my library from the standard HTML element properties. Is `@id` valid? What about `$id`? Can I use a `:`?

These questions are easy to answer by opening the console, but wouldn’t it be nice to have a little tool to validate JavaScript variable names? Thankfully it already exists: [Mathias Bynen’s](https://mathiasbynens.be/)[JavaScript variable name validator](https://mothereff.in/js-variables).

With it you can quickly validate a variable while maintaining your flow. And if you’re curious as to why, [he has an article explaining the specifications](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6). While writing this, I noticed that [the main site has a bunch of other little tools](https://mothereff.in/) for you to checkout. (Pardon the name 🙊)

Up the web!
