title: My first RSS Club oopsie
description:
  I accidentally published the latest article to the public because I mixed up
  some frontmatter fields
tags:
  - RSS
pubDate: 2023-07-04T07:49-0400
verse:
flags:
  - RSS-ONLY

My latest article, [_Losing steam_](/articles/losing-steam), was supposed to be
an exclusive for the RSS Club. But I confused `tags: RSS-ONLY` with
`flags: RSS-ONLY` in the frontmatter, and now it is published for the world to
see: oops!

(Note to self: avoid data field names that rhyme)

I could fix it but that would break my feed, and I really like the idea of RSS
as being the source of truth for my content. It is what it is!

So forgive my mistake, and enjoy the article. I look forward to hearing from
anyone who has suggestions for writing prompts.
