[MDN distinguishes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API#concepts_and_usage)
between two different "popover" UI patterns:

1. **Modals**: prevent interaction with overlapped elements, use `dialog`
   element
2. **Non-modals**: allow interaction with overlapped elements, use Popover API

Conceptually this is helpful, but I wish we had more consensus across
engineering and design on these terms.
