I was introduced to the idea of Axios’ Smart Brevity on the
[_How I Built This_ podcast](https://www.goloudnow.com/podcasts/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz-113/politico-axios-jim-vandehei-397089).
Based on the reality that people don’t read much, the idea is writing that
presents information as clearly and concisely as possible. Axios has pushed this
model successfully with 200-400 word news stories that liberally use bulleted
lists.

This was attractive to me, in part, because I find writing to be struggle. I
want to be a good writer, but I think my voice pales in comparison to the
writers that I admire. Rather than trying to match their wit or charm, perhaps I
could provide value by being direct and informative.

I followed the podcast episode by
[watching Jim VandeHei’s TEDx talk on Smart Brevity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGy1o4jLkJc).
Here some some key points (loosely quoted):

- On data to support this approach:
  - Nobody reads anything
  - Humans are built to keep up with so much information
  - More often than not, people who share stories haven’t read them
- Tips for writing better:
  - **Stop being selfish**: Writing is self-indulgent. We don’t think about the
    purpose. What does the reader need to know?
  - **Grab me**: What is the most important thing? What is the reason that
    you’re writing? What is the one thing that I need to remember?
  - **Keep it simple**: Shorter. Simple, strong words.
  - **Be human**: Write like a human. We’re think we’re Walt Whitman; we try to
    show off with our writing. If you’re talking to someone at a bar, you’re not
    going to use SAT words or use acronyms.
  - **Just stop**: The best thing you can do in this cluttered world is give
    people their time back. Use as few words, in as few sentences, as humanly
    possible.
- In your own mind you’ll find yourself start to think more clearly and speak
  more clearly.
