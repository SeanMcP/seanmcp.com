In 2023 I want to making this site better. Here is an unordered list of tasks
that I would like to complete by the end of the year:

- **Adopt
  [Astro content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)**:
  I have two different systems for articles and notes, and it would be great to
  standardize with the new API.
- **Redesign with emphasis on personality**: This will involve selecting and
  serving a font, which I have avoided up to this point.
- **Astro-less callouts and embeds**: I want the reusability of components
  without needing to use MDX.
- **RSS-only articles**: Seem like a fun feature
  ([ðŸ¤« RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/))
- **Fix the trailing whitespace in my header links**: I donâ€™t know what the
  cause is â€” maybe something with how the Astro code is formatted?
- **Mastodon posts in the homepage**: Probably a little component to load recent
  toots on the client.
- **Explore CMSs**: I have Netlify CMS configured, but between its bugs and the
  lack of support I would like to find a better option.
- **FART-less dark mode**: Iâ€™ve read a few different strategies for this, but I
  want to find the best option for this site.
- **Optimizations**: Iâ€™d like to find a good/cheap solution for serving
  responsive images, and reduce any unnecessary network requests.

Iâ€™ll probably convert this list into
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/seanmcp/seanmcp.com/issues) like a good
developer at some point in time. Until then!
