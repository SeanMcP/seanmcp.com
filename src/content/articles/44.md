I've added a bookmarking feature to the site! When you're looking at an article
or note, you'll see a little bookmark icon to the top right. If you toggle that,
it will save the page in `localStorage` and highlight it whenever you browse
[articles](/articles) or [notes](/notes).

I know that I'm going to find this useful, and I hope that you do too! ðŸ”–
