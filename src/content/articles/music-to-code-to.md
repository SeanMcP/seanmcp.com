Whenever I need to put my head down and focus on a coding task, I have found that listening to music can help me focus and increase my productivity.

There are two main criteria that I have for music while I am programming: 1) it needs to be instrumental, and 2) it needs to have a decent beat/tempo. If a song can check both of those boxes, then it gets added to the rotation.

Here is a list of songs/artists that I enjoy listening to while I work, in alphabetical order:

- [Arcade High](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCT7LeKzJCc5P1AKY1Ghxjiw)
- [Com Truise](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC3G1cV92stSGOy4cLgXmgJQ)
- [Dynatron](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCov2JBrKDko0xcwfIwhEAfw)
- [Magic Sword](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCnl2TnNDgp2rUepf5VnXJ1g)
- [S U R V I V E](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCec-IpmkXJQhgnkBIx1EGxQ)
- [Timecop1983](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCVjNyglpxEwPoB65b0Oc4Ew)
- [Waveshaper](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCzdwXtAUt8VgaDXfTfttx8A)

As of writing, these artists are all in similar, but as the lists grows I plan on organizing things by genre.

Happy listening!
