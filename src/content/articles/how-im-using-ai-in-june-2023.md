AI products/services that I used regularly (multiple times per week):

- **GitHub Copilot** ⭐: Copilot continues to be a valuable resource when coding.

AI Products/services that I used occasionally (once per week or less):

- **Bard** 📉: Although a rising star last month, I found that the quality of its
  answers seemed to decrease over the past month. That could be due to the types
  of questions I was asking (primarily Go coding questions) or changes under the
  hood.
- **Bing** 📉: I use Edge as my daily browser and will occasionally send it a
  question, but it doesn’t play a big part in my workflow.
- **Warp** 📉: Handy to look up a common command without leaving the terminal, but
  that isn’t something that I need to do regularly.

AI products/services that I have access to but did not use:

- **Bing Images**
- **ChatGPT** 📉
- **Dall-E**
- **Notion**
