Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

## [Machine](https://xkcd.com/2916/) by XKCD

_Machine_ is a collaborative interactive where you help build a machine that
moves colored balls from point A to point B. Once you have completed your task,
you can take a look at the machines that others have built. It's really neat and
an interesting change of pace for XKCD.

## [Africa by Toto but its played on instruments in Majora's Mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av5oRf88aso) by bigfatfrown

I really like YouTube, but sometimes I get nostalgic for the simpler, amateur
past. This video is only two years old, but it feels like one from an earlier
era of YouTube.

## [Truncate: A word-based strategy game](https://truncate.town/)

This one took some time to understand, but it's a fun little combat-style word
game. It's a challenging and refreshing alternative to more traditional word
games.

## [Canabalt](https://canabalt.com/)

I have a soft spot for all Flash games, and I have fond memories of playing this
one on Flashplayer.com (RIP). It's a simple infinite runner game, but the
artistic style and the feel set it apart. See if you can beat 2000 meters.
