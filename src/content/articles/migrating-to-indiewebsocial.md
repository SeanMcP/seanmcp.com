Today I migrated from [fosstodon.org](http://fosstodon.org) to
[indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social). You can find me
[@seanmcp@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@seanmcp). In the process, I
found
[this guide by Josh Justice](https://codingitwrong.com/2022/10/10/migrating-a-mastodon-account.html)
to be really helpful.

Why migrate? I initially migrated to Fosstodon from
[Mastodon.social](http://Mastodon.social) because I wanted an instance that was
more focused on technology. I dabble in open-source maintenance, so the FOSS
part of Fosstodon was intriguing.

What I did not realize at the time is that FOSS is its own thing. There was tons
of discussion about Linux distros and desktop environments that went way over my
head.
[Iâ€™m a general fan in free and open-source software](/series#trying-linux-2022)
but not big enough.

Iâ€™m more interested in the indie-web scene than FOSS, so Iâ€™m thinking that the
new instance will be a better fit. But weâ€™ll see! The grass is always greener ðŸŒ±

Following account were migrated and links here have been updated.
