[`color-scheme` is a CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme)
that affects the "theme" of a website. You can use it to quickly switch a page
to dark mode with:

```css
html {
  color-scheme: dark;
}
```

It's pretty neat, but it only applies to certain elements. You can use it on
`html` to set the scheme for the entire page, and on some form control elements
like `input` and `select`.
