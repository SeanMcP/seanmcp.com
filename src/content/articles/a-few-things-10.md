Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

## [Lake Retba: The Pink Lake of Senegal](https://www.lakeretba.com/)

Lake Retba is one of
[many pink lakes in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_lake), that
are colored by bacteria or algae. The lake is a source of salt production for
the surrounding communities in addition to being a tourist attraction.

## [How Farmers Reshaped a Region and Solved Drought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79VUAFq2rbg) by Andrew Millison

This is the second video that I've shared from Andrew Millison (see
[A few things #6](/articles/a-few-things-6)). In this video, he learns about a community
in northern India that used permaculture to transform environment for the better
over the course of 45 years.

I was struck by the long-term commitment to collective action for the benefit of
all. That's the stuff that it feels like we can only dream of here in the United
States.

## [Did Idaho Get Its Name As A Result Of A Hoax?](https://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/did_idaho_get_its_name_as_a_result_of_a_hoax) (hoaxes.org)

The US state of Idaho may have been named a man making up a Native-American
word. He initially proposed "Idaho" as a name for Colorado which was rejected.
But his
[made-up word that meant "gem of the mountains"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho#Etymology)
was planted in the minds of many, and eventually became the name of a different
state.

This is, if Idaho even exists at all:
