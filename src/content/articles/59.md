I've been digging into web components recently and open-sourced two components
today:

- [dark-mode-toggle](https://github.com/SeanMcP/dark-mode-toggle-web-component)
- [nav-search](https://github.com/SeanMcP/nav-search-web-component) (still a
  WIP)

Both of them follow the
["HTML web component" pattern](https://adactio.com/journal/20618) of adding
interactivity to their children without touching the shadow DOM.

I think there is a lot of potential in this pattern, so I'm excited to explore
it with more components.
