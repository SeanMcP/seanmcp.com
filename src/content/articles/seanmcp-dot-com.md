## Design considerations

- Color palette needs to look nice with code blocks
- Colors for each content type
- As of 11/28/2023, there are no `h5` of `h6` elements on the site

## Unorganized thoughts

- I'd prefer to have a single color scheme for the site and bypass the idea of
  light/dark mode. Maybe there is a "middle" mode that will make everyone happy.
- I like writing with lots of headings, but "big and bold" styles make those
  articles look bad.
