- **Simplicity**: Keep the maintenance cost of your site low
- **Cost**: Keep serving your site cheap. Free hosting with free-tier services.
- **Durability**: Keep the site up. Remember,
  [cool URLs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html)
- **Experimentation**: Try things. Be weird. Add and remove features at will.
  It's your site.
- **Transparency**: Keep the code for your site open source so that other can
  learn from it and you.
- **Privacy**: Keep users anonymous. Unless you are selling something, the less
  you know about your visitors the better.
