I ran into an issue this morning where Astro stopped working on my Windows machine. `2.0.9` is working on MacOS but gives the following error in Windows:

```
runtime: out of memory: cannot allocate 4194304-byte block (4030464 in use)
fatal error: out of memory
```

I don't think this is an Astro issue, since nothing has changed since it was last working. I don't know of anything that changed in my enviroment, but maybe there is a memory leak somewhere causing me to run out?
