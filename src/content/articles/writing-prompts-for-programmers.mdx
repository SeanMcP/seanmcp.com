## How to use these prompts

These prompts were curated for freewriting, an exercise to help you get started
writing. To start, follow these steps:

1. Pick a prompt that piques your interest
2. Grab a pen and paper or open a text editor
3. Set a timer for 5, 10, or 15 minutes
4. Write until the timer goes off

Once you are done, it's up to you: stop or continue, discard or publish. The
goal was to write and strengthen those muscles, and you've succeeded!
