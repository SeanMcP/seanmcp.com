I tested positive for COVID-19 in November of 2020, a few weeks after the birth
of my second son. My wife was the first in our household to show symptoms, and I
followed a few days later.

Most of my symptoms were mild. I had full-body aches and congestion but no fever
nor loss of taste. The most dramatic symptom was fatigue that came in waves for
the duration of my illness. I would go from feeling mostly fine, to feeling like
I didn't have the energy to situp, then back to mostly fine in the span of
thirty minutes. I'm thankful that I was on parental leave for the whole duration
of my illness, because I would have been unable to work effectively through the
waves of fatigue.

Once I recovered, that seemed to be the end of it. I warned by coworkers to take
the virus seriously (they already were) and tried to be especially careful
during the holidays.

Fast-forward to March of 2021, and now a new symptom has emerged. There are now
certain scents that have changed for the worse: bananas, toothpaste, and
shampoo. They all share the same smell, and it is quite unpleasant. A kind of
savory/overly-ripe odor that I am keen to avoid. I used to eat a banana a day
(or more), and now I can't stand to be too near to them.

I have heard that some people report a return to normal taste and smell after
being vaccinated. Hopefully that is true, because I'd really like to enjoy
eating bananas and brushing my teeth again.

In April of 2021, I got the first round of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. By the
following morning, I experienced some typical "flu-like" symptoms: fatigue,
full-body soreness, and skin sensitivity. The injection site – my left shoulder
– was especially sore. By day two, most of the symptoms had resided.

Bananas, shampoo, and toothpaste still smell odd but to a lesser degree. I'm
optimistic that that will improve in the coming weeks! The second round of
vaccination is scheduled for early May – four weeks after the first round. By
then, Lord willing, I'll be back to a banana a day!
