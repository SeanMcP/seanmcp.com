Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[_Design Patterns that Encourage Junk Data_](https://css-irl.info/design-patterns-that-encourage-junk-data/)
   by Michelle Barker**<br/>I don't think the thought has occurred to me before,
   but our digital footprints are huge and ever expanding. And all of that data,
   from old forum accounts to Google Docs from high school to random photos on
   various platforms needs to live somewhere.

   Personally, I _like_ being able to access all of that. I _like_ that data
   feels permanent. But maybe that's because I don't bear the cost of that
   availability. And maybe I should think about more and more deeply. Good food
   for thought.

2. **[_How the UN is Holding Back the Sahara_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCli0gyNwL0)**
   by Andrew Millison<br/>The UN is working with local communities in the
   African Sahel to build a "Great Green Wall" to 1) reclaim low-quality
   soil, 2) increase local agriculture, and 3) prevent the southward spread of
   the Sahara. For more information, checkout
   [thegreatgreenwall.org](https://www.thegreatgreenwall.org/).

3. **[_The Book of Kells_ Collection](https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en)
   at Trinity College Dublin**<br/>After last week's article about text
   illuminations, I wanted to track down the most famous illuminated text: The
   Book of Kells. The detail of the illustrations is stunning, and the colors
   are beautiful. Take a few minutes and explore the pages of this 1200-year-old
   book.

4. **[Trivia Pig](https://triviapig.com/)**<br/>A fun Wordle-style game with
   daily trivia questions in 8 different categories. I don't see it being a
   runaway success, but it's good for a quick diversion.
