I spent some time this morning looking into [`zx`, Google's tool for writing shell scripts in JavaScript](https://github.com/google/zx). They have a lot of neat features baked in, but one of the coolest I saw was the ability to [execute scripts from a Markdown file](https://github.com/google/zx/blob/main/docs/markdown.md).

That's a much more approachable way to document scripts than code comments! âœ¨
