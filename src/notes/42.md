Iï»¿'ve been a big fan of CodeSandbox.io since it released. However, recently I noticed that when you want to convert a sandbox to a GitHub repository, it requires access to your organizations too.

I'm happy to give them access to my GitHub account, but I do not want to give them permissions to edit repos at Khan Academy. This seems like strange oversight from the CodeSandbox team. ðŸ¤”
