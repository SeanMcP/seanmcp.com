I started watching Brian Vaughn's [_Deep dive with the React DevTools profiler_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySib7ipZdk) to learn more about using the React Profiler, but there are a bunch of general tips for creating more performant React applications as well.

Watching it was a good use of 37 minutes!
