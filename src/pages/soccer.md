I am a big fan of soccer. There is something about the game that I find captivating, from the play, to the players, the teams and the leagues.

Soccer connects me to billions of other fans around the world, bisecting geography, language, and culture. I can think fondly on many conversations that I've had with neighbors from around the world about the beautiful game.
