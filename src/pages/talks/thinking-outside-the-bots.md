**Overview**: The explosion of large-language models in the past few years has
turned everyone's attention to AI. OpenAI's ChatGPT has pioneered a new pattern
for human-model interactions that other companies have been eager to follow. But

analyze and critique current patterns of human-model interactions and consider a
more human-centric future for AI.
