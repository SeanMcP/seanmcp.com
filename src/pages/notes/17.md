This morning I added a new page with an embedded emoji picker: https://www.seanmcp.com/sm/emoji-picker/

It embeds [Nolan Lawson's `emoji-picker` web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@@npm/emoji-picker-element) in a webpage and prompts you to copy when selecting an emoji. You can see the [source code here](https://github.com/SeanMcP/seanmcp.com/blob/master/src/sm/emoji-picker.njk).

I'll use this when doing computer activities with my three-year-old son, but others may find it useful as well.
