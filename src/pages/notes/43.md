This morning I spent some time trying out [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the first time, and... it did not go well ðŸ™ˆ

I say this as a big Svelte fan, but it feels like Kit was designed to be unpleasant to use. Complicated patterns at every turn, and an undecipherable build for the uninitiated.

My hope was that SvelteKit would be a great tool to build projects in Svelte (that _is_ what it says on the tin), but I guess I'll need to look elsewhere.
