One of the things I miss most about Windows when working on macOS is the window management.

I've tried a few window management apps in the past, and today I'm giving [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) a spin. So far, the keyboard shortcuts feel logical and the app isn't trying to do too much.

We'll see how it goes!
