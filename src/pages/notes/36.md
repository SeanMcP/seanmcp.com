I added a new feature to the site called "stars." When it is enabled, you can
add a little star anywhere on the site by tapping. I'm planning to write an
article about why I wrote it, but in the meantime let me know if you have any
feedback on the feature: sean@seanmcp.com

**Edit**: Stars are dead. [Long live bookmarks](/notes/44)!
