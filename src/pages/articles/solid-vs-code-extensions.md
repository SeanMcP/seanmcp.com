I [use](/uses) VS Code as my daily editor, and one of its best features is the wide selection of extensions. However, as with any other large marketplace, discoverability is a real issue.

In an attempt to resolve that issue, here is a curated list of some great VS Code extensions that you might not have tried before:

- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker): This extension has saved me from committing embarrassing spelling mistakes on multiple occasions.

- [Copy GitHub URL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattlott.copy-github-url): Adds commands to copy the URL for the current location on GitHub. Obviously more helpful if you use GitHub a lot.

- [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html): Adds syntax highlighting for ES6's multiline strings. Just add a comment `/*html*/` and your backticked strings are more usable.

- [Format Comment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rodrigocfd.format-comment): Adds a command to nicely format comments. Really nice if you prefer the `//` syntax to `/** */` (which VS Code already formats nicely.

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): Adds a button to the bottom status bar to launch a local development server in the current directory. Never Google "serve directory python" again!

Happy extending!
