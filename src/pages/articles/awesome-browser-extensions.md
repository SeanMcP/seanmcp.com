Extensions can slow down your browser, so I try to only add ones that are
necessary or super helpful. Here is a list of the extensions that make the cut,
grouped by category and listed alphabetically:

## General use

- [Disable automatic gain control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-automatic-gain-co/clpapnmmlmecieknddelobgikompchkk):
  I've written
  [an article about this extension already](articles/prevent-chrome-from-adjusting-audio-input-levels-on-mac/);
  it prevents Chrome from automatically adjusting the gain for your audio input.
  I couldn't use Meet on Chrome without this extension!
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm):
  Simple and effective ad blocking. **Add this on every grandparent's
  computer!**

## Developers

- [axe DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd):
  Adds an accessibility audit panel to the developer tools.
- [Markdown Editor for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/monaco-markdown-editor-fo/mmpbdjdnmhgkpligeniippcgfmkgkpnf):
  Converts GitHub's default `textarea` into a full-featured Monaco editor. This
  means you can use your favorite VS-Code keyboard shortcuts when editing issue
  descriptions and PR comments.

This list will grow over time, so feel free to
[email suggestions](mailto:sean@seanmcp.com?subject=Suggesting%20an%20extension)
and check back later. Happy extending!
