VS Code is a great all-around editor.

## Commands

- **Fold All** collapses all code blocks for the current file. Very handy when you are exploring a new file that is super long.

## Extensions

- Code Spell Checker
- Git Blame
- GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
- Live Server
- Prettier
- Search node_modules/

## Settings

- **Format on save**: `editor.formatOnSave`
