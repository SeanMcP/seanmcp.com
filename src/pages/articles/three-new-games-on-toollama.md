I don't think I've written about Toollama.com yet on this site, so here's a quick introduction. Toollama is a loose collection of education-focused productivity tools and games. For the past year, it has been the home of all of the little apps that I create for myself, teachers, or my kids.

Over the past three weeks, I have created two new games and one new activity to help children develop core computer skills:

- 🐢 [Turtle Guide](https://seanmcp.github.io/turtle-guide): Use the arrow keys to help a little turtle find his way home
- 🐷 [Paint Pig](https://seanmcp.github.io/paint-pig): Use the arrow keys to help Pig paint a picture
- 🔦 [Spotlight](https://seanmcp.github.io/spotlight): Use the mouse/trackpad to reveal animals hidden in color nature scenes

From a technical perspective, these are all vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML served from GitHub Pages. I've found that solving problems with simple tools has been a relaxing change of pace from the complex environments of work. As always, the code is open source on GitHub: [`turtle-guide`](https://github.com/seanmcp/turtle-guide), [`paint-pig`](https://github.com/seanmcp/paint-pig), and [`spotlight`](https://github.com/seanmcp/spotlight).

These additions bring the grand total on Toollama up to 13 apps! [Check it out, if you haven't already](/tools).

Happy learning!
