2019 was an exciting year, though perhaps not as [eventful as 2018](./2018-into-2019). Here are some of the major events and accomplishments of the past year in mostly chronological order.

## 2019 in review

Last year, I:

- **Officially hit one year in the industry**: My previous experience is valuable but scattered; this is one year straight of work
- **Took on new work responsibilities**: I began work as a UI Engineer lead at TSYS
- **Accepted first conference talk**: I got the news in June that I was accepted to speak at Connect.Tech 2019
- **Attended two conferences**: Abstractions in Pittsburgh and Connect.Tech in Atlanta
- **Interviewed at multiple companies**: Dusted off the ol' code challenge skills
- **Accepted an offer at Niche**: Front-end Software Engineer at an exciting company in Pittsburgh
- **Moved to Pittsburgh**: Said a sad "goodbye" to all our wonderful friends in Atlanta
- **Added some new features to Niche.com**: Most of them minor, but it's neat to see your work in action
- **Spoke at a conference**: _React and Accessibility_ at Connect.Tech 2019
- **Started a learning program at Niche**: Weekly tech learning sessions over lunch with live demos
- **Published eleven npm packages**: And learned a lot about package management along the way
- **Passed 10K downloads on a package**: `a11y-react-emoji` is off to the races!
- **Published thirteen articles**: [Off the mark](./reviewing-2019-goals), but still solid

Some of these things were fulfilling goals that I had set in the previous year, while others were completely out of the blue. I'm so thankful for the opportunity to try new things this past year.

## Previewing 2020

Looking forward to this year, there are several things that I want to learn and do. I am going to list some general goals, followed by measurable ways that I can accomplish them.

- **Read more**: I want to read **four professional** and **six personal** books
- **Open source**: I want to become a maintainer on an open-source library (that I didn't create)
- **Write more**: Last year I missed the mark, so I'm going to set a goal of publishing **18 articles** in 2020
- **Speaking**: I want to create a deck and **present at a Meetup** here in Pittsburgh
- **Father**: I want to use the time I have with my son more productively, **going on father-son outings twice a month**
- **Faith**: I want lead **family worship every day**, and **read/reflect on the Bible daily**
- **Fitness**: I want to exercise 5 days a week
- **Soccer**: I want to find room in the family schedule to **play a pick-up game twice a month**
