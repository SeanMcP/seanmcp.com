I enjoy playing board games with family and friends. They're a great vehicle for
creating memorable experiences and building relationships.

Here are the things that I look for in a board game:

1. **Play time**: The shorter, the better. I would rather play and re-play a
   game four times in a session than play a single game once.
2. **Strategy**: I don't care for games revolve around random events like dice
   rolls or drawn cards. I want to be able to craft and execute a strategy.
3. **Cooperation**: Working together to solve a problem is more interesting to
   me than competition.

## Favorites

These are some of my favorite games, broken down by category.

  emphasizes game speed and competition

  [Taboo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1111/taboo) but with a wonderful
  injection of [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)
- [Upwords](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1515/upwords): This enhanced
  [Scrabble](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/320/scrabble) is a nice option

### Card games

- [Sushi Go!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go): A card game
