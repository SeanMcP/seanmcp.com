import ArticleList from "../components/ArticleList.astro";

My name is Sean McPherson, and I’m a software engineer interested in all areas of front-end development: from HTML and CSS and JavaScript frameworks to mobile apps and developer tools.

Currently I work at Khan Academy building web and mobile applications in React and React Native. On the side, I like to work on little projects that help make people’s lives easier.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, two sons, and dog), playing and watching soccer, re-playing my favorite board games, and trying not to embarrass Jesus Christ.
