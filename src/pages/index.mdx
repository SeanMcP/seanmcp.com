<p class="lede()">I'm glad you could stop by. My name is Sean McPherson 
(SeanMcP for short), and this is my little website. Make yourself at home!</p>

I'm a software engineer and former teacher on a mission to use technology to 
help people help people. Currently I work as a software engineer at 
[Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) building web applications.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, two sons, and dog),
playing and watching soccer, re-playing my favorite board games, and trying not
to embarrass Jesus Christ.
