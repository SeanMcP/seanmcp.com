My name is Sean McPherson, and I’m a software engineer at Khan Academy building
web and mobile applications in React. On the side, I like to
[work on little projects](https://github.com/seanmcp) that help make people’s
lives easier.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, two sons, and dog),
playing and watching soccer, re-playing my favorite board games, and trying not
to embarrass Jesus Christ.
