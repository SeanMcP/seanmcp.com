Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Sean McPherson, or [Sean McP](/articles/how-to-pronounce-my-name) for short, and I am a software engineer for [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Before that, I worked for [Niche.com](https://niche.com) in Pittsburgh helping students and parents find the right school. At Niche, I organized weekly "Learn Over Lunch" sessions to facilitate shared professional development.

And before that, I worked for [TSYS Digital Innovations](https://www.tsys.com/) in Atlanta creating products for financial institutions and their clients. I helped them focus on recruiting new talent and pushed for open-sourcing software.

I have had the opportunity to:

- Give a few conference talks on accessibility and React
- Publish a few open-source libraries on npm
- Lead workshops on React and the JavaScript ecosystem
- Give lightning talks at a meetup

After college, I spent three years teaching at public and private schools. It gave me valuable experience in learning, planning, and speaking, and my goal is to bring those lessons into all of my work. This website is an example of that.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time with my wife (married '14), two sons (born '18 and '20), and our three-legged dog (adopted '17). I also [like soccer](../soccer).
