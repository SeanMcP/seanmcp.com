I am a big fan of soccer. There is something about the game that I find captivating, from the play, to the players, the teams and the leagues.
Soccer connects me to billions of other fans around the world, bisecting geography, language, and culture. I can think fondly on many conversations that I've had with neighbors from around the world about the beautiful game.
I actively follow the English Premier League, German Bundesliga, and the United States' national teams, but I keep tabs on teams and leagues across the world. My favorites are:

- <Icon url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c2/West_Ham_United_FC_logo.svg"/> West Ham United (England)
- <Icon url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/FC_Augsburg_logo.svg"/> FC Augsburg (Germany)
- <Icon url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle.svg"/> Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC (Scotland)
- <Icon url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Pittsburgh_Riverhounds_SC_2018_logo.svg"/> Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC (USA)
- <Icon url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/United_States_Soccer_Federation_logo_2016.svg"/> US Soccer

[Let me know who you support and why](mailto:sean@seanmcp.com?subject=Soccer%2FFootball%2FFútbol%2FFußball); I'd love to have a reason to follow a new club in another league.
