description: "A personal statement of faith. tl;dr: I'm a Christian."

I am a Christian, and I seek to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. I am by
nature a sinner, but I have been saved by God's grace through faith in Christ. I
am a member of [a local church](https://www.covenantfellowship.org/) and serve
as a deacon.

I affirm the Apostles' Creed, a statement of faith that has been used by
Christians for over 1,500 years:

> I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus
> Christ, His only begotten Son, our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
> Born of the virgin Mary; Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead,
> and buried; He descended into hell. The third day He arose again from the
> dead; He ascended into heaven; And sits on the right hand of God the Father
> Almighty; From there he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe
> in the Holy Ghost; The holy catholic church; the communion of saints; The
> forgiveness of sins; The resurrection of the body; And the life everlasting.
> Amen.

In addition, I believe in the
[five _Solas_ of the Reformation](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/what-are-the-five-solas):

1. _Sola Scriptura_: Scripture alone
2. _Sola Fide_: Faith alone
3. _Sola Gratia_: Grace alone
4. _Solus Christus_: Christ alone
5. _Soli Deo Gloria_: Glory to God alone

I accept the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/the-westminster-confession/)
and the
[Westminster Shorter](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/westminster-shorter-catechism/)
and
[Larger Catechisms](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/westminster-larger-catechism/)
as faithful summaries of Scripture's teachings.
