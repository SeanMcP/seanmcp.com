## Outline

- Introduction
  - In the past year, I have reignited a passion for LEGO that I had as a kid
  - I enjoy spending time building with my sons
  - And I think there is something we can learn from LEGO
- Learning from LEGO
- Composability
  - LEGO
    - Bricks can be combined into an infinite number of builds
    - Each piece is designed to be used in conjunction with other unknown pieces
  - Programming
    - Our functions need to be designed to work alongside and with unknown functions
- Systematic
  - LEGO
    - Every brick is designed to work within the LEGO System via a unifying "API"
    - Input always equals output
    - This unlocks composability and helps simplify expansion
  - Programming
    - A uniform communication method from which we build our systems
- Techniques
  - LEGO
    - Multiple building techniques to accomplish specific design challenges
    - Each technique excels in a particular area, but may be ineffective in others
  - Programming
    - Learn and utilize different programming techniques and paradigms
    - Carefully choose the best technique for a given situation
    - Resist the temptation to choose the inefficient familiar or clever option
- Testing
  - LEGO
    - Rigorous quality control to ensure that all bricks are high quality
    - Continual testing of connection strength when building
  - Programming
    - Have systems in place at every level to verify the quality of production code
    - Regularly stress test to ensure a high-quality product for users
- Refactoring
  - LEGO
    - Countless solutions for solving the same problem
    - System encourages working through alternatives to find the best solution
    - They even provide a tool specifically for taking your builds apart!
  - Programming
    - Use rapid prototyping and compare POCs
    - Build in sprint time to try multiple solutions for feature work
    - Policy for addressing technical debt before it accrues too much interest
