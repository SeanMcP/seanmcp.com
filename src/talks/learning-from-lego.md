## Outline

- Introduction
  - Founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932 Denmark
  - Originally produced wooden toys
  - Developed first plastic bricks in the 1950s
  - Now one of the largest toy companies in the world
    - LEGO sets (licensing)
    - LEGO stores
    - LEGO amusement parks
    - LEGO media (_e.g._ _The LEGO Movie_, _LEGO Star Wars_ video games)
- Principles
  - Systematic
    - LEGO
      - Every brick is designed to work within the LEGO System via a unifying "API"
      - Input always equals output
      - Serves as a design constraint that simplifies iteration, expansion
    - Programming
      - A uniform communication method from which we build our systems
  - Composability
    - LEGO
      - Bricks can be combined into an infinite number of builds
      - Each piece is designed to be used in conjunction with other unknown pieces
    - Programming
      - Our functions need to be designed to work alongside and with unknown functions
  - Techniques
    - LEGO
      - Multiple building techniques to accomplish specific design challenges
      - Each technique excels in a particular area, but may be ineffective in others
    - Programming
      - Learn and utilize different programming techniques and paradigms
      - Carefully choose the best technique for a given situation
      - Resist the temptation to choose the inefficient familiar or clever option
  - Testing
    - LEGO
      - Rigorous quality control to ensure that all bricks are high quality
      - Continual testing of connection strength when building
    - Programming
      - Have systems in place at every level to verify the quality of production code
      - Regularly stress test to ensure a high-quality product for users
  - Refactoring
    - LEGO
      - Countless solutions for solving the same problem
      - System encourages working through alternatives to find the best solution
      - They even provide a tool specifically for taking your builds apart!
    - Programming
      - Use rapid prototyping and compare POCs
      - Build in sprint time to try multiple solutions for feature work
      - Policy for addressing technical debt before it accrues too much interest
