## Outline

- What is React?
    - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
    - A component-based architecture
    - A declarative approach to building UIs
- Strengths
  - Community
    - Most popular front-end framework
  - Ecosystem
- Weaknesses
  - Un-opinionated
    - As an individual contributor, this can be liberating. But as a team, it is
      a challenge.
- Alternatives
  - Vue
  - Svelte
  - Solid/Qwik
  - JavaScript/Web Components (_e.g._ Lit)

  - Ensure client-side interactivity has a fallback
  - If you're going to use React
    - Use a framework
      - Next.js
      - Remix
      - Astro
