We owned a dog for eight years. In that time, I picked up a lot of dog poo. Each
time gave me an opportunity to reflect, and I've distilled that into some axioms
for home-owners and dog-owners. With these in mind, we can all live more
peaceful lives together.

## Home-owners

- **Everybody/thing poops**: Animals are pooing in your yard right now. It's
  gross, but it's natural. Don't get worked up by something that every living
  organism does.
- **You are not your yard**: It's okay to take pride in your yard, especially if
  it's something you enjoy and work towards. But its imperfections do not change
  your self worth. Let them go; you're not in control.
- **You (probably) don't own the edge of your yard**: In many places, the area
  adjacent to the road is owned by the local government. Someone using the first
  few feet of "your" yard isn't on your propertyâ€“they're on the government's.
- **Dog walkers build community**: They're out 1-2 times per day, rain or shine.
  They smile, they wave, they talk, they notice things. Dog owners make your
  community stronger. Embrace them; don't chase them away.

## Dog-owners

- **Pick it up. Every time. No exceptions**: Waste is natural, but it still
  stinks and carries diseases. If you run out of bags, leave your shoe next to
  the poo and come back.
- **Buy the rolls of dog waste bags**: They're cheap, appropriately sized, and
  won't surprise you with holes like shopping bags. Keep a roll with you
  wherever you go.
- **Mix it up**: Don't let your dog go in the same yard every day. Train your
  dog to have a few options on your route, and then use them all. Or vary the
  route.
- **Avoid common areas**: Don't let your dog go right by someone's front walk or
  the edge of the driveway. Pick inconspicuous spots.
