I am mission driven, and my mission statement two-fold:

Professionally, my mission is to use technology to help people help people. I
want to use my skills as a developer to create tools that empower people to do
good in this world. That could be teachers, doctors, parents, government or
non-government organizations, or a small-business owner.

Personally, my mission is summed up in this exchange from the Gospel of Mark:

> And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and
> seeing that [Jesus] answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the
> most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O
> Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your
> God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with
> all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as
> yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” – Mark 12:28-31
> (ESV)

In other words: love God, and love my neighbor.
