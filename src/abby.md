In 2017, we adopted Abby from an Atlanta-area animal shelter in 2017. This
lovable pup had been at the shelter before and was given up at two. Those owners
left a broken arm untreated, and the shelter staff made the difficult decision
to amputate it.

Christened "Abby Normal" (a reference to Mel Brooke's _Young Frankenstein_), we
took her home, and she was a lovely part of our family for eight years. She died
in 2025 with lymphoma.

She loved running around in the backyard, chasing groundhogs, and eating
carrots.
