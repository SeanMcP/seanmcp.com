title: Are command bars the future?
description:
  Command bars are a great way to access functionality through a single user
  interface, but how much potential does this pattern have to change the way we
  interact with products?

[Maggie Appleton recently wrote about "Command K Bars"](https://maggieappleton.com/command-bar),
those command line bars that you pull up with a keyboard combination. In
addition to giving a lot of cool product recommendations, she explained the
pattern for designers:

Some notable examples of this in my line of work are:

- Slack <kbd>CMD + K</kbd>
- VS Code <kbd>CMD + P</kbd>
- Chrome DevTools <kbd>CMD + P</kbd>
- Notion <kbd>CMD + K</kbd>
- GitHub <kbd>CMD + K</kbd>

I, for one, absolutely love this pattern. It's so nice to be able to quickly
jump to a command without needing to remember where the button is in the UI or
even the exact name for it. These command bars definitely improve my workflow.

However they feel like a very developer-focused pattern, extending to products
for companies that work in tech. I'm skeptical at this point that the pattern is
ready for mainstream products.

In a quick survey of popular information and social-media sites, I found no
command K bars.

It's also worth noting that the command key is Mac-centric. In tech we can
probably get away with that since it has large sections that are dominated by
Mac users, but that isn't the case for products with broader audiences. Maybe
swapping command for control is sufficient, or maybe switching to the meta key
makes more sense. It might take time before a true standard emerges.

I think command bars are a great pattern, and I'm looking forward to using them
in more ways and on more sites. But I wouldn't prioritize that feature work
unless you are in an industry that caters to developers or the companies that
employ them.

What do you think: are command bars the wave of the future? Let me know.

Happy interacting!
