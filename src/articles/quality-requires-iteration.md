  You're not going to write the perfect program on your first attempt; it's
  going to take multiple iterations to arrive at the best solution

You're not going to get it right the first time. You might not even get it right
the second time. But if you iterate enough, you're going to find a good
solution.

Too often I catch myself overanalyzing the first pass at a problem. I spend too
much time _thinking_ about how the whole system needs to work, or all of the
edge cases that need to be addressed, and trying to plan the Perfectâ„¢ solution.

But it is never the case that plan A is the final solution. So why spend so much
time agonizing over the first attempt?

Think about the problem that you need to solve, sure. Consider the edge cases
that come to mind, definitely. Then move quickly on to building something.

Write a function once to figure out how it needs to work, and then write it
again now that you know more.

Throw a bunch of messy components in a single file while you figure out what the
UI requires and how you can compose them. Then refactor and move things into
their own files (with individual stories and tests).

If you have time, iterate again... and maybe again. Each pass should get faster
and more direct, because your knowledge of the problem is increasing the the
picture of the solution is growing more clear.

Plan to make several attempts at the solution. Plan to delete what you've
written. Plan for several rounds of code review. Plan to plan less up front and
more as you go.

Quality in programming requires iterations. So lean into it.
