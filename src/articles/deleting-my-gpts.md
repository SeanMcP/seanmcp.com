description:
  GPTs provided little value to me now, little potential value in the future,
  and were the only thing locking me in my Open AI subscription.

Today I deleted all of my public and private
[GPTs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/). I thought I would feel sad:
they were the feature that convinced me to start paying for OpenAI last year.
But instead it feels like an anticlimactic end to an experiment.

When custom GPTs were initially launched, I was interested in an official
playground for prompt engineering with the potential of a marketplace. I spun up
a few and even [wrote some articles about it](/tags/gpts). But the feature
fizzled and the market hasn't panned out.

Beyond a questionably-accurate conversation count, OpenAI doesn't provide even
basic usage data. Critical measures like recent sessions, average conversation
length, and bounce rate are all missing. Maybe you could overlook that if your
GPTs made a few bucks a month, but there is no market and no clear road to one.

That was enough to convince me, but paying for the privilege of keeping these
GPTs online wore me down too. I don't like being tied down with subscription
services, and GPTs were the only thing keeping me in the OpenAI ecosystem. So I
deleted them.

Without the GPTs, I'm free to switch to Claude (which all my cool
prompt-engineer friends say is better) or nothing at all. $20 a month goes
pretty far at a food bank or international charity.

If you were a faithful user of my GPTs, then I apologize for the change. But
dozens of users are not enough to justify the expense or the lock-in. Send me an
email, and I will share everything you need to make your own.
