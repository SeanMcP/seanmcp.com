Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[_Kintsugi â€“ Art of Repair_](https://traditionalkyoto.com/culture/kintsugi/)
   by Traditional Kyoto**<br/>I've been reading _Art + Faith_ by Makoto Fujimura
   and learned about Kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics
   with gold. The beauty for me, beyond the stunning contrast between earth and
   metal, is that the restored object is greater than the original.

2. **[Taste.io](https://www.taste.io/)**<br/>There are other services that
   provide movie and TV recommendations, but Taste appears to be above average.
   The basic service is free, but they charge to view more recommendations.

3. **[drawing.garden](https://drawing.garden/) by Ben Moren**<br/>Tend a small
   garden with emojis and pleasant tones. A relaxing... game? App? Experience?
   I'm not sure.

4. **[_Elephants swimming_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpD40ewOyC4) by
   Katey B**<br/>My son asked me this week if elephants can swim. We both
   learned something that day.
