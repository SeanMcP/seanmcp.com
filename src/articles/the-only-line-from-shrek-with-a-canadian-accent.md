After replacing Chris Farley as the voice of Shrek,
[Mike Myers initially recorded his lines with a Canadian accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kce6BiBBBs)
before switching to the now-iconic Scottish accent. Twenty-three years later,
it's hard to imagine Shrek sounding any other way.

But I believe that a remnant of the first recording–a single line with the
original Canadian accent–made it into the final film. Listen closely to Shrek in
this scene:

<em-bed>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqVzY0Kd7A">Watch "It's on my to-do list!" on YouTube</a>
</em-bed>

> Fiona: You didn't slay the dragon?
>
> Shrek: It's on my to-do list.

It's a short line, but the word "to-do" in particular is delivered in a way that
doesn't match the rest of Shrek's lines. Compare it to the Scottish accent in
the words "you" and "doing" here:

<em-bed>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZfryF4I2B8">Watch "What are you doing in my swamp?" on YouTube</a>
</em-bed>

I'm convinced that this single line with the original recording made it into the
final film. But what do you think?
