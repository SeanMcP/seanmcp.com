Publishing this article will be the 1000th commit to my website repository. This
makes it my most-active and side project by a large margin.

I created the repo in April of 2019 as the successor to
[a Gatsby site](https://github.com/SeanMcP/.com) that was
[powered by Eleventy](https://github.com/SeanMcP/seanmcp.com/tree/231e93ae7b353432148b54e065248d8724f610b9).
That version continued until the fall of 2022 when
[I rewrote everything in Astro](https://github.com/SeanMcP/seanmcp.com/tree/53841b172d875f54bd63fc972f97c28d949f73c3).
Since then I’ve logged over a third of those 1000 commits; the pace of
development is going strong.

Reflecting on the last four years of development, I can say that building this
site has been a valuable use of my time. Working on this site has provided
opportunities to:

- practice skills
- learn new techniques, and
- explore new technologies.

Plus it’s rewarding to have created a valuable resource that helps thousands of
visitors every month.

Here’s to the next 1000!
