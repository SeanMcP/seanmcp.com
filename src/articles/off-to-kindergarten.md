Today is the first day of Kindergarten for my first-born son, Samuel. At 8:00pm
this morning we'll drive him to school, and his 13+ year journey in education
will begin.

I'm excited for this new chapter of his life, but I'm going to miss him a lot.
Since the pandemic started in 2020 and I started working from home, I have had
the privilege of seeing, talking to, and playing with Samuel almost every
weekday.

I loved when he would stop by during the day and tell me a fact that he learned
while reading, show me a picture that he drew, or share something he thought was
funny. I loved eating lunch with him, getting random high-fives and hugs, and
taking a tickle break during the day.

I'm thankful that my wife was able and willing to mother him full-time--we've
both gotten to know him so well over the past 5 years. I'm thankful that I work
from home and can be around for her and the kids throughout the day. I'm
thankful that Samuel is off to a wonderful school that will both challenge and
encourage him. I'm thankful for the one-on-one time that we will get with Ezra
while his big brother is at school.

Life transitions like this can be hard for both parents and kids. I know I'm
feeling the full range of emotions! So I'm going to try to hold them all gladly
today: excited, nervous, proud, scared, optimistic, sad, hopeful.

> Godspeed, Samuel. May the road rise to meet you. May the wind be ever at your
> back. May the sun shine warm on your face. May the rain fall gently on your
> fields. And until we meet again: may God hold you in the hollow of His hand.
