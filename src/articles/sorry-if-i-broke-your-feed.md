  Content has moved around and the result might confuse your RSS reader.

I'm in the process of completing a
[rewrite of this site in Eleventy](/articles/rewriting-in-eleventy-again), and
have moved a bunch of content around. Last year I made the foolish decision to
make everything an article and therefore part of the RSS feed. That was a
mistake and so a lot of articles have been removed.

Feedbin at least is able to reconcile the changes without too many issues, but I
apologize in advance if your RSS-reader-of-choice does not handle the changes
well.
