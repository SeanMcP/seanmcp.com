_The Copper Caves_ is a simple dungeon-crawling setting for any table-top
role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons. It is designed to be procedurally
generated with a progressive challenge as the players delve deeper into the
caves.

**Setting**: The Copper Caves have long been a source of material for
industrialists and beauty for naturalists. But in these latter years the
monstrous spider Ashlaw and her thousands of offspring have infested the caves
bringing an end to their use and enjoyment. Now they lay dormant, the spiders
patiently waiting to claim their next victim.

Many adventurers enter the Copper Caves in search of treasure but few return.

**Procedure**: Start at room level 0. When entering a new room, roll on the
following tables and adjust the room level as needed.

| d6  | Room level change |
| :-: | ----------------- |
|  1  | -1 level          |
| 2-5 | Same level        |
|  6  | +1 level          |

| d8 + Level | Item of interest              |
| :--------: | ----------------------------- |
|    0-4     | Nothing                       |
|     5      | Geological feature            |
|     6      | Animal/creature/human remains |
|     7      | 1d12 spider egg sacks         |
|     8      | Living NPC                    |
|     9      | Adventuring gear\*            |
|     10     | Treasure/copper\*             |
|     11     | Dead NPC                      |

|     13     | Great treasure\*              |

\* The spiders make nothing and horde nothing. All items found are left behind
by their victims.

| d6  | Spider encounter |
| :-: | ---------------- |
| 1-3 | Spiders!         |
| 4-6 | No spiders       |

| Level | Spiders                      |
| :---: | ---------------------------- |
|   0   | 1d6 spiders                  |
|   1   | 2d6 spiders                  |
|   2   | 1d6 spiders + 1 giant spider |
|   3   | 1d6 giant spiders            |
|   4   | 2d6 giant spiders            |
|   5   | 2d6 giant spiders + Ashlaw   |

**Ashlaw**, monstrous spider

Intelligent and cunning, her eight legs are as thick as trees, covered in hair
and dripping with venom. She likes to paralyze her victims and wrap them in silk
to eat later.
