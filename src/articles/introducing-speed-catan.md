For the record: I like _Settlers of Catan_. But as I age, I have less interest
in games that can be unbalanced or take a long time. A decade ago my friends and
I came up with [_Sanders of Catan_](/board-games/sanders-of-catan) to improve
balance and increase speed, and it is still my favorite way to play _Catan_.

But then I had kids and needed to increase speed while also decreasing the
amount of time spent setting up and cleaning up the game.^[It is common in our
house to spend a long time setting up a game only to have the kid lose interest
half-way through.] So we came up with
[_Speed Catan_, a faster and simpler way to play Catan](/board-games/speed-catan).

The main change is that instead of setting out the circular number tokens (or
chits) and using them to determine what resources to draw, you set the resource
and development cards in an ordered list on the table. Whenever you roll the
dice, you draw the resource based on it's index in the list.

It also introduces a time-based win scenario where the player with the most
victory points after _x_ minutes wins (I recommend 15 minutes). And finally it
removes the robber because who wants to play with crying kids? You can
[read more and see examples here](/board-games/speed-catan).

With these changes we are able to complete a full game with young children and
no conflict!

If you have an old version of _Catan_ on the shelf, I recommend dusting it off
and playing some _Speed Catan_ with the kids or adults in your life. Then let me
know what you think.
