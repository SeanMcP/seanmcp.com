Last year I experimented with using a Raspberry Pi as a home development
environment. The device was ultimately too low powered, but my interest was
piqued. Linux has improved a lot since my last experiments with it in the early
2010s.

Encouraged by that experience and
[a coworker who uses Linux](https://definingterms.com/) at work and home or
development, I decided to try again with a more powerful device. I considered
buying a new laptopâ€”[Pinebook](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/) and
[System76](https://system76.com/laptops-ultraportables) look promisingâ€”but I
opted instead for a Lenovo Yoga from 2017 that we had lying around. It has an
Intel i5, 128GB SSD, and 4GB of RAM which felt sufficient. Plus, it feels good
to give new life to an old device.

After some internal debate, I ended up installing Ubuntu. There are probably
distros that would have been better for an older device with simpler specs, but
bog standard should be good enough for me. I didnâ€™t have any issues with drivers
this time (ðŸ™Œ), and the only feature that I lost was the fingerprint reader.
Overall, the experience of installing Linux on the laptop was great.

Outside of work, Iâ€™ve been using this Linux laptop almost exclusively for the
past month. It runs well, the battery life is decent (Power Mode helps a lot),
and Ubuntu has been a great development environment. I work mostly in the
JavaScript world, and the computer is able to handle some resource-intensive
Node.js processes. Iâ€™ve also been learning Go, and all of that runs without the
fan.

Iâ€™ve installed Microsoft Edge for browsing and VS Code for editing, but outside
of that Iâ€™m trying to keep things lean. I know that 128GB will fill up fast, so
Iâ€™m trying to limit installs to only the essentials. To date, that hasnâ€™t been a
limiting factor: turns out your donâ€™t need much to write web apps and Go
scripts!

In summary, Iâ€™m happy with my current set up. The experimenting with Linux in
2022 helped prepare me to use it as my daily driver in 2023.
