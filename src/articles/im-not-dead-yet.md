I found out at the end of August that I talk that I proposed for Pittsburgh
TechFest 2023 had been accepted. This was excited, but there was a catch: I only
had two weeks to prepare the presentation.

So I spent the first two weeks of September working on that talk to the
detriment of everything else (sidebar: thank you wife Anne for accommodating
that!). And thankfully the "two week deadline" for all presentation materials
turned into three weeks, and I was able to get everything ready in time.

But that means that I am back and ready to start writing again. It felt fitting
to return with an article for you, the RSS Club. I'm looking forward to sharing
some of the details from my presentation and writing about other topics that I
have been thinking about over the past few weeks.

See you soon!
