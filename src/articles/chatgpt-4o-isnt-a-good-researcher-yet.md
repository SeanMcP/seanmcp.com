I asked ChatGPT 4o for general recommendations for
[software release frequency](/articles/astro-and-release-frequency/), and it
spouted out some information that seemed generally plausible. I asked it to cite
its sources, and after an internet search it provided three links. I checked all
three, and none of them contained the information that ChatGPT initially
provided.

I replied with "None of those articles had the guidelines that you cited" and it
responded back with more information and more links. I checked a few of them,
but it was the same as before. They were on the same topic, but the information
that ChatGPT provided was not sourced from those articles.

I don't know what I expected, but it's clear that ChatGPT 4o isn't a reliable
research assistant yet. It can provide you some common ~~misconceptions~~
information, but it isn't going to point you to a true source consistently.
You're going to need to research for yourself.

Use with caution.
