Zed is a new Rust-powered editor by the creator of Atom that focuses on speed
but lacks a lot of features.

**My experience**: I downloaded Zed after hearing
[the creator talk about it on the Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast/531).
And my first impression was that it just feels fast. Opening the application,
navigating projects, and editing files are all zippy. The integrated terminal
does the job without fanfare.

**The numbers**: Zed compares itself favorably to Sublime Text, VS Code, and
CLion
[in three metrics on its homepage](https://zed.dev/#engineered-for-performance),
but I found Sublime to have a significantly smaller install size:

- Sublime Text – 126MB
- Zed – 312MB
- VS Code – 526MB

**Trade-offs**: Zed is missing a lot of features that I expect from a modern
editor.

- The editor is missing autocomplete, block moving shortcuts, and does silly
  things like matching quotation marks in comments.
- The search is missing find and replace, filtering by path or filetype, and
  collapsing/removing results.

As a result, my rate of development was noticeably slower in Zed than in VS
Code.

**Takeaway**: Zed is a fast editor in the same vein as Sublime Text and is a
good option for a lightweight second editor. But for modern front-end
development, Zed lacks the features to be your daily driver.

There are a number of interesting collaboration features that I haven’t tested.
I didn’t want to ask a coworker to download Zed when I knew the editor was
lacking.

Zed has a solid foundation that may enable it to outpace other editors in the
future – but it’s not there yet.
