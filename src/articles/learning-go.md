[Niche](https://niche.com) and [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) use Go
for their backend services, so I've been "reading" Go since 2019. But as I
progress in my career, I'm realizing that it would be useful to understand Go at
a deeper level, and even write some Go code when the need arises.

For the past few weeks I've been going through
[_Go by Example_](https://gobyexample.com), a "hands-on introduction to Go using
annotated example programs", and logging my progress here:
[seanmcp/go-by-example](https://github.com/seanmcp/go-by-example).

So far, I am enjoying the experience. _Go by Example_ is well designed: the
examples are clear and the concepts build upon each other well. And the
development environment setup for Go is straightforward:

1. install Go,
2. write `.go` files in your editor of choice, and
3. run programs from the command line.

I've been using VS Code with the official Go extension, and it's been great --
even on an older laptop.

My favorite features so far:

- The built-in **formatter**: it's nice to not have to think about how your code
  should be formatted.
- Generating **executables**: I've played around with Deno's compiler for this,
  but Go's feels more mature.
- Simple **syntax**: you don't need to remember a lot of syntax to write Go
  code.

My not-so-favorites:

- Conventions are **too terse**: you can name things whatever you want, but
  reading through examples with 1-3 letter variables gets old. `timer.C` is not
  explicit.
- The name **Go**: it's too common a word for a programming language, which
  makes searching online for challenging. Using "golang" tends to work, but even
  the title of this article might confuse people.

The negatives aside, I'm looking forward to continuing this journey. If you have
any recommendations or resources, please let me know!
