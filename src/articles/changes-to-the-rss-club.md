Last month I created this RSS Club for special articles shared exclusively with
my RSS subscribers. The idea came from Dave Rupert, but I differed from his
pattern by omitting articles entirely from my website. I said at the time:

> If you want to read that content, the only way to do so is with an RSS reader.

That decision was a mistake, so Iâ€™m going to make some changes. It remains true
that the only way to **find** an article for the RSS Club is with an RSS reader,
but I made some changes internally to create pages for them. That way you can
bookmark an interesting article, and/or share it with someone else.

My current plan is to send articles to the RSS Club monthly. Will they all be
RSS-related? That remains to be seen ðŸ˜…, but stay tuned for more.

In the meantime, Iâ€™d love to hear from you: **what is your RSS reader of
choice** and **what do you like about it**? Let me know by email:
[sean@seanmcp.com](mailto:sean@seanmcp.com?subject=RSS%20Readers)

If I get some interesting responses, Iâ€™ll include them in a future article.
