Hey RSS Club! Long time no see. I've gotten out of the habit of writing to you this year, but I wanted to give a heads up about upcoming changes to the site.

I'm going to be merging gardens and notes into articles to create a single content type. As a result, there will be a bunch of new entries into the RSS feed that may affect you, dear reader. I apologize for any inconvenience, but I think this is the right move for the health of this site going forward.

I have really enjoyed creating gardens this year with the explicit permission to edit/change content as the page grew. So while the "Garden" content type is going away, the ethos is carrying on into articles. Rather than a resource that is set in stone when published, I'm going to treat articles as living documents that will change over time.

To summarize the changes: Soon everything will be an article, and articles will be more like gardens.
