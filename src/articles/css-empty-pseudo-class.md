- `:empty` allows you to apply styles to an element when it has no child nodes
- This is useful for hiding empty elements to keep visual grids consistent
- It is supported in all major browsers

When building a user interface, it is common to have a container element that
conditionally contains content. A simple example is an element that displays
error information when a form field is invalid. To accomplish this, you have two
options:

1. Always render the container in the DOM and conditionally add children (_e.g._
   text, other nodes)
2. Conditionally render the container when needed.

There are use cases for both approaches. When working with vanilla JavaScript, I
typically reach for the former. If I were building the interface with a
front-end library, then I use the later.

A problem that arises with option 1 is spacing in between elements. If you are
using flex box or grid with a `gap` the empty element will be included in the
layout and will result in a double space between visible elements.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="KKxaQmo" data-user="SeanMcP" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>

The solution is to use the :empty pseudo class to select the empty element and
hide it with display: none. Once the element is removed from the flex/grid, the
gap between elements are consistent.

It is worth noting that the double spacing is not an issue with patterns like
Every Layoutâ€™s stack, which uses the browser's collapsing margins. But if you
are using flexbox or grid, then the problem will eventually arise.
