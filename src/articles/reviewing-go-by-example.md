I started [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) in April with the goal of
learning the language for work. [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) (and my
old company [Niche](https://niche.com)) use Go for their back-end services. And
while I am focused on the front end, knowledge of the Go language is valuable
for my work.

It took me 80 days from start to finish to complete the 79 examples. After a few
starts and stops in the beginning, I settled into a routine of starting each day
(barring Sunday) by working through an example. This felt like a good pace to
learn the syntax and patterns slowly so that it sticks. And I think that it has,
for the most part!

Overall, I enjoyed the exercises, and I would recommend Go By Example to anyone
who is interested in learning the Go language. The examples were focused and
clear, and the progression of concepts was logical. After completing the course,
I feel confident reading and writing Go, and feel like I could contribute to an
existing project.

One criticism of the course is that it does little to explain how Go projects
work beyond simple scripts. I don’t have clear understanding of “packages” in Go
which made it difficult to explore the language with side projects. There was an
example on how to make a simple HTTP server but no details on how to deploy one.

To be fair, that wasn’t the point of the course. But if you’re looking for a
more holistic introduction to Go, you might need to supplement Go By Example
with something else.

So I’m looking for an additional resource to fill in some of those knowledge
gaps. If you have any recommendations, [please let me
know](mailto:sean@seanmcp.com?subject=Go%20Resources). Otherwise, I’ll write again
when I have found something that works well.
