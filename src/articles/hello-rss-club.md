This article is only visible to those who have subscribed to my site via RSS. So
if you are reading this, then you are a member of
[the RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/)!

My favorite thing about RSS is the autonomy that it gives you as a reader. You
have the freedom to subscribe to content that interests you. That could be
textual, like this blog, or images or audio. You choose the content, and then
you choose how to consume it with an RSS Reader. It bypasses the vendor buy in
of content platforms and puts you in the driver's seat.

These days I've been enjoying [FeedBin](https://feedbin.com) for reading RSS
feeds. The best features for me (though not unique to FeedBin) is piping
newsletters into the reader. I had built up a few subscriptions in my inbox, but
that never felt like the right platform for reading content. If your RSS reader
has the option, I recommend it.
