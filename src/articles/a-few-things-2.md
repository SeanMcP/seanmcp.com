Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[_Craft vs. Content: Resisting Mediocrity in a Dual-Existence Age_](https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/craft-vs-content-resisting-mediocrity-in-a-dual-existence-age/)
   by Brett and Kate McKay**<br/>The pressure to constantly share is powerful,
   and it has particularly impacted makers. "The modern writer, artist, or
   entrepreneur is not only tasked with promoting the final product of their
   efforts, but sharing inside looks of their art _in progress_, and even
   offering tips on how the average viewer at home can improve their own craft".
   Is there room for those who want to focus on their art and not the content
   around it?

2. **[_How the NFL got so rich_](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6pxu3s2VTQE) by
   Search Party**<br/>The NFL is one sport among many watched primarily in a
   country with many other popular sports. So why is it far and away the most
   profitable league in the world with the most valuable teams? In this video,
   Search Party answers this question by going back in time and comparing its
   development to European soccer leagues.

3. **[Lightning & Thunderstorms World Map](https://www.blitzortung.org/en/live_lightning_maps.php)
   by Blitzortung.org**<br/>Lightning is fascinating--beautify and deadly. This
   map shows lightning strikes and thunderstorms in real-time, and it is
   mesmerizing. As I write this, there are lightning storms in the Gulf of
   Mexico, the Middle East, and off the eastern coast of Australia.

4. **[The Presidential Ham](https://presidentialham.com/) by Bijijoo**<br/>Oil
   paintings of every US President holding ham. Very surreal. Not at all kosher.
   I'm looking forward to Biden's portrait.
