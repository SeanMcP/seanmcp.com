I [use](/uses) VS Code as my daily editor, and one of its best features is the
wide selection of extensions. However, as with any other large marketplace,
discoverability is a real issue.

In an attempt to resolve that issue, here is a curated list of some great VS
Code extensions that you might not have tried before:

- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker):
  This extension has saved me from committing embarrassing spelling mistakes on
  multiple occasions.

- [Copy GitHub URL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattlott.copy-github-url):
  Adds commands to copy the URL for the current location on GitHub. Obviously
  more helpful if you use GitHub a lot.

- [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html):
  Adds syntax highlighting for ES6's multiline strings. Just add a comment
  `/*html*/` and your backticked strings are more usable.

- [Format Comment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rodrigocfd.format-comment):
  Adds a command to nicely format comments. Really nice if you prefer the `//`
  syntax to `/** */` (which VS Code already formats nicely.

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer):
  Adds a button to the bottom status bar to launch a local development server in
  the current directory. Never Google "serve directory python" again!

- [Search node_modules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasonnutter.search-node-modules):
  Adds a command to search the `node_modules/` directory in your project. VS
  Code ignores those files by default, so having a method to go spelunking in
  your dependencies is really handy.

Happy extending!
