Here are a few things that I found interesting this week:

1. **[_Handwriting but not typewriting leads to widespread brain connectivity_](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full)
   by Van der Weel _et al_.**<br/>Researchers at the Norwegian University of
   Science and Technology studied how handwriting and typewriting affected brain
   activity:

   > "When writing by hand, brain connectivity patterns were far more elaborate
   > than when typewriting on a keyboard, [which existing research shows] are
   > crucial for memory formation and for encoding new information... Our
   > findings suggest that [handwriting contributes] extensively to the brainâ€™s
   > connectivity patterns that promote learning."

   I remember hearing of similar research I was in college, and it was the main
   reason that I took notes by hand instead of on a laptop. I'm glad to see that
   there's more research on the topic and that those hand cramps were not in
   vain.

2. **[_The mystery of the medieval fighting snails_](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231221-the-mystery-of-the-medieval-fighting-snails)
   by Zaria Gorvett (BBC)**<br/>Gorvett looks into the history of medieval
   [illuminations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript),
   decorative illustrations that were added to the borders of a text. The subject of the illuminations did not need to match the text, and "for a
   brief period in the late 13th Century, illuminators... across Europe embraced
   a new obsession: fighting snails.". Gorvett explores the possible reasons for
   the trend--none of which consider the possibility that there were megafauna
   snails in the medieval period.

3. **[Liz Climo Cartoons](https://www.gocomics.com/liz-climo-cartoons/2018/05/07)**<br/>I
   saw one of these cartoons on
   [r/wholesomememes](https://reddit.com/r/wholesomememes) and wanted to track
   down the creator. All of Climo's comics feature cute animals in relatable
   situations. Very wholesome.

4. **[Banana Prices](https://xkcd.com/2892/) by XKCD**<br/>When a student asks
   their Math teacher "Why do I need to learn this?", they should be shown this.
