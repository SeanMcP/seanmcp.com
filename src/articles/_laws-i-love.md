## Laws
- **The Golden Rule**: Treat your neighbor as you would like to be treated
- **Campbell's Law**: Using an social indicator for decision-making will lead to distortion and corruption of the process it is intended to monitor ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law]
- **Goodhart's Law**: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
- **Parkinson's Law**: Work expands to the time allotted
