Sorry for two months in one post, but I haven't been using AI much recently. I
think the trend so far is that AI-powered products that are directly related to
my work are more likely to stick around. All the others come and go more
quickly.

AI products/services that I used regularly (multiple times per week):

- **GitHub Copilot** ⭐: Copilot continues to be a valuable resource when
  coding.

AI Products/services that I used occasionally (once per week or less):

- **Warp** 📈: I have used Warp's AI-powered command suggestion occasionally
  over the past two months. It's helpful when I'm looking for a git command or
  something similar but can't quite remember the flags or syntax.

AI products/services that I have access to but did not use:

- **Bard**
- **Bing** 📉
- **Khanmigo** 📉
- **Dall-E**
- **MDN** 📉
- **Notion**
