We got a report on a Saturday morning that there was a dead deer on the street
in front of our church building.
[Allegheny County has a large deer population](https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2024/10/28/allegheny-county-pittsburgh-deer-crashes/stories/202410250115),
and its likely that this deer was killed in a traffic accident.

I called
[the regional office of the Pennsylvania Game Commission](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/about-us/contact-information/offices-and-regions/southwest-region.html)
and asked for help. The operator in Harrisburg looked up the address and learned
that the street was a state road. They then redirected my call to
[PennDOT in Allegheny County](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/penndot/contact-us.html)
for maintenance.

The operator at PennDOT took the address and said that they would try to get it
cleaned up that same day.

It is important that you do not attempt to remove the deer without proper
equipment and training. Dead animal bodies can carry diseases that will make you
and others sick. Unless you know what you're doing: leave it to the
professionals.
