Based on
[the unofficial results from Allegheny County](https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/PA/Allegheny/123625/web.345435/#/detail/0566),
Kellen Lovejoy looks to have defeated incumbent William Smith III in the
Democratic-Party primary for Wilkinsburg Council Ward 1.

If results stand, Lovejoy—a resident of
[Atkinson Place](https://atkinsonplace.com) in Wilkinsburg—will go on to
represent the Democratic Party in the General Election in November. He received
more votes than his opponent in every district of Ward 1:

| District  | Lovejoy | Smith III |
| :-------: | :-----: | :-------: |
|     1     |   97    |    41     |
|     2     |   53    |    29     |
|     3     |   35    |    17     |
|     4     |   134   |    34     |
|     5     |   95    |    19     |
|     6     |   83    |    61     |
| **TOTAL** | **497** |  **201**  |

Smith III is the current Wilkinsburg Council President, and his defeat means
that the Council will need to select a new President in the coming year.

Official results will be posted on Friday, May 23, but it is unlikely that Smith
III will receive enough absentee ballots to overturn the approximately 300 vote
difference.
