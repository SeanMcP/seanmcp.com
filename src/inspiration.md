## Design

Listed alphabetically.

- [JoshWComeau.com](https://joshwcomeau.com/): The little details across Josh's site are wonderful. Sound effects (!), small animations, and custom illustrations combine to make a unique design.
- [RobSterlini.co.uk](https://robsterlini.co.uk/): What sets Rob's site apart for me is the dual focus on typography and layout. The typefaces give the site character, and each page has personality.
